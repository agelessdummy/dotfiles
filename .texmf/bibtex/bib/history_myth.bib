	Annote = {This article has a double-barreled purpose: to raise some important questions and to sketch out a conceptual framework for an anthropology of the young. The first part of the article raises the question: Is anthropology of education, through an emphasis on such themes as school ethnography, observational methodology, curricular development, and the schooling of native peoples, moving towards narrowness and specialization? Or to turn the question around: To what extent is the field still based in an anthropology that is general, pan-human, and evolutionary in scope? The main thesis of the paper is that an anthropology of the young might be a useful move in the latter direction. In the second part of the paper, a conceptual framework for an anthropology of the young is sketched out, in terms of four points: Defining the young, describing their cultural patterns, understanding their cultural dependence, and coping ethnographically with the problems of development. The article closes with a brief attempt to argue the advantages of such an approach to professional educators and anthropologists of education.},

	Annote = {Drawing upon theories that reconceptualize toys and artifacts as identity texts, this study employs mediated discourse analysis to examine children's videotaped writing and play interactions with princess dolls and stories in one kindergarten classroom. The study reported here is part of a three-year ethnographic study of literacy play in U.S. early childhood classrooms. The specific focus here is on young girls who are avid Disney Princess fans and how they address the gendered identities and discourses attached to the popular films and franchised toys. The study employs an activity model design that incorporates ethnographic microanalysis of social practices in the classroom, design conventions in toys and drawings, negotiated meanings in play, and identities situated in discourses. The commercially given gendered princess identities of the dolls, consumer expectations about the dolls, the author identities in books and storyboards associated with the dolls, and expectations related to writing production influenced how the girls upheld, challenged, or transformed the meanings they negotiated for princess story lines and their gender expectations, which influenced who participated in play scenarios and who assumed leadership roles in peer and classroom cultures. When the girls played with Disney Princess dolls during writing workshop, they animated identities sedimented into toys and texts. Regular opportunities to play with toys during writing workshop allowed children to improvise and revise character actions, layering new story meanings and identities onto old. Dolls and storyboards facilitated chains of animating and authoring, linking meanings from one event to the next as they played, wrote, replayed, and rewrote. The notion of productive consumption explains how girls enthusiastically took up familiar media narratives, encountered social limitations in princess identities, improvised character actions, and revised story lines to produce counternarratives of their own.},

	Annote = {The concept of enculturation has not been given its articulate definition. Therefore, it has been used inconsistently in anthropology as well as in other fields. Various anthropologists have tended to regard enculturation as consisting of such processes as socialization, the acquiring of culture, and cultural internalization, excluding an innovative process of enculturation. Herskovits' definition, however, is more elaborate, and, furthermore, includes a process of novel change and inquiry. Two phases of enculturation, according to him, can be distinguished: the "unconscious" stage of early years in human growth, where the individual "unconsciously" internalizes his culture; the "conscious" stage of later years, which involves innovations initiated by individuals. He contends that these two phases constitute the total process of enculturation. The problem inherent in Herskovits' arbitrary separation of the early years from the later in human learning and teaching lies in that this separation is contradictory to psychological findings, existential, Gestalt, and "personological." In these findings, it is evident that the cultural learning of childhood (both formal and informal learning) is also reflective and conscious, although it must be admitted that a greater or lesser degree of cultural internalization does go on "unconsciously" in individuals and cultures. It is necessary to reduce the cleavage between the two phases and to emphasize the continuity that develops throughout the entire process of human life. The assumption that most individuals in a given culture successfully achieve the uniform internalization of that culture yielding its microcosm in the personality structures of individuals is also questionable. Wallace's argument (1961:1-44) against the traditional culture and personality school proves this. It is proposed that enculturation be defined as a construct, and a process in a behavioral sense, that delineates transmission and transmutation of culture throughout human growth. Cultural transmission is a process of acquiring the existing culture; cultural transmutation, on the other hand is a process of psychosocial mutation through deliberate, reflective, functional, yet occasionally incidental processes of teaching and learning. Enculturation, thus,involves innovation and inquiry which is a particular type of epistemological sensivity to culture. It is a bipolar process and a universal function of education in a culture.},

The images found in fairy tales, therefore, have particular importance for children of color in relation to the internalization of White privileging. This article presents a comparative analysis of the Disney version of six classic fairy tales spotlighted in Disney's Princess: The Essential Guide against the "classic" source text versions: Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp from the perspective of ideological/racial basis in the context of the goals of multicultural education. Findings from this analysis support the need for the development of critical literacy skills in children as well as in their teachers and highlight the importance of exposing children to transcultural literature.},

A postmodern analysis of these multiple discourses reveals the marginalized voices and excluded stories of a darker side of the Disney legend. Tamara, a play that is also a discursive metaphor, is used to demonstrate a plurivocal (multiple story interpretation) theory of competing organizational discourses. Subsequent sections address storytelling organizational theory, analyses of official accounts of Disney enterprises, and less well known, even contrary, accounts. The article concludes with implications for postmodern theory and future storytelling research projects.},

	Annote = {A central question for ethnological theory has been: At what age do human beings begin the process of enculturation? An important consideration in answering this question is the now ample evidence from various quarters that the perceptual/cognitive competence of the pre- and perinatal human being is significantly greater than was once thought. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the theoretical and methodological implications of this emerging picture of early competence for ethnology. To this end I will present a review of some of the developmental neuropsychological, psychobiological and social psychophysiological research indicating pre- and perinatal perceptual/cognitive competence and learning. I will then suggest some issues that this competence raises for ethnological theory and research. /// Une question centrale pour la th{\'e}orie ethnologique a toujours {\'e}t{\'e}: A quel {\^a}ge l'{\^e}tre humain commence-t-il le processus d'apprentissage culturel? Une importante consid{\'e}ration dans la r{\'e}ponse {\`a}cette question se trouve {\^e}tre l'{\'e}vidence, maintenant accumul{\'e}e par differents secteurs, que la comp{\'e}tence perceptuelle et cognitive de l'{\^e}tre humain aux stages pr{\'e}natals et p{\'e}rinatals est significativement plus {\'e}tendue qu'on ne pensait. Le propos de cet article est de discuter les implications th{\'e}oriques et m{\'e}thodologiques, pour l'ethnologie, de ces nouvelles possibilit{\'e}s de comp{\'e}tence pr{\'e}coce. A cette fin, l'auteur pr{\'e}sente d'abord une revue de la recherche sur le d{\'e}veloppement neuropsychologique, psychobiologique et socio-psychophysiologique montrant les niveaux de comp{\'e}tence et de capacit{\'e}d'apprentissage aux stages pr{\'e}natals et p{\'e}rinatals.

Malinowski's instrumental theory of myth is contrasted with the cognitive theory advanced by L{\'e}viStrauss, and certain didactic functions of myth are also discussed.},

The components elicited constitute a new definition - more precisely, a two-dimensional model of the relationship between myth and history. Subsequently, the model is applied to a series of books from the Bible with the conclusion that men and women are structurally equal since, in their roles as social actors, both represent different components of myth as well as history.},

This paper argues that, at least for the interpretation of South American myth, an integrated approach is essential. After reviewing the epistemological basis of current problems in myth studies, the paper attempts a structural analysis of myths with the theme of a metamorphic conjugal union between human and nonhuman. Processual considerations are introduced in the form of syncretic myth, and the argument is advanced that there exist syncretic transformations of a structural nature. Identifying these provides the beginnings of a bridge between structure and process, and leads to an examination of the performative context of the subject myth. Other narrative genres, dealing with explicitly ethnic concepts, are implicated in the processual sequence of the telling and interpretation of the tale. The attempted synthesis of structure and process in narrative analysis leads to an engagement with two difficult problems: the relationship between ethnicity and kinship; and the transition from myth to history.},

A consideration of Greek beliefs suggests that L{\'e}vi-Strauss is incorrect in tying certain events in that myth to the "overvaluation of blood relations" and in asserting that the myth is concerned with the "affirmation/denial of man's autochthonous origins." The second half of the article presents a different structural analysis of the entire Theban Saga, of which the Oedipus myth is but a part. It concludes (1) that L{\'e}vi-Strauss is correct in identifying a series of events in the myth which indicate the devaluation of blood relations, but that these events specifically refer to the devaluation of patrilineal kin ties and that the range of events indicating the devaluation of patrilineal ties is broader than his analysis would suggest, and (2) there is another series of repeated events (unmentioned by L{\'e}vi-Strauss) which indicates the affirmation of patrilineal kin ties. The final hypothesis - that the opposition between the devaluation/affirmation of patrilineal kin ties underlies the Theban Saga - "makes sense" in terms of Greek history, as the period in which the Olympian myths took their present form is also the period in which the Greeks moved from a society organized along patrilineal kin ties to one organized around allegiance to the polis},

Generic groups considered are diluvian myths, myths involving abrupt subsidence, abrupt uplift, and simultaneous abrupt subsidence and uplift. Specific myths, recently validated, illustrate the superiority of the mythic explanation for recent volcanism over available geological information, and the possibility of myth recalling a migration which took place nearly 3000 years ago. The implications of the correct interpretation of the geographical basis of myths for an understanding of environmental change in the Pacific are explored. Particularly in a region where written history is relatively recent, myths have the potential for extending available chronologies of particular phenomena and allow consideration of issues such as the role of infrequent catastrophic events in landscape evolution and the role of (rapid) environmental change in cultural transformation to be considered more fully.},

There is substantial evidence, however, that the Native American landscape of the early sixteenth century was a humanized landscape almost everywhere. Populations were large. Forest composition had been modified, grasslands had been created, wild-life disrupted, and erosion was severe in places. Earthworks, roads, fields, and settlements were ubiquitous. With Indian depopulation in the wake of Old World disease, the environment recovered in many areas. A good argument can be made that the human presence was less visible in 1750 than it was in 1492.},

The task for archaeologists is to understand the sorts of histories at work in different periods. We propose a distinction between genealogical history, where the past is created through links to known ancestors, and mythical history, where a less well-known past is evoked. These two forms of history coexist in all societies with implications for the manner in which continuities and change are handled. We illustrate the insights that these ideas may provide through a case study from the late Bronze Age to Romano-British periods on the Ridgeway in south Oxfordshire, southern England.},

	Annote = {Myth and history are generally considered antithetical modes of explanation. Writers of each tend to distrust the data of the other. Many historians of the modern period see their task as one of removing all trace of myth from the historical record. Many students of myth consider history to have less explanatory power than traditional narratives. Since the Greeks, logos (word as demonstrable truth) has been opposed to mythos (word as authoritative pronouncement). In more general terms myth may be defined as any set of unexamined assumptions. Some modern historians have become aware that much so-called factual history is interfused with such assumptions. What we call history is at best mythistory. Some even suggest that there can be no real distinction between the discourses of myth and history, between fact and fiction. The Agastya-Aurobindo narrative is an example of an account based on factual materials that gradually became transformed into fiction. It is accepted by some as historical truth; however when its development is studied critically, one can see that successive narrators "euphemistically" transformed its constituent propositions. The Ramjanmabhumi narrative (at the center of sectarian conflict in India) took form in much the same way. It is not possible to accept these legends as historical truth, though there is no reason why they could not be used as the basis of artistic creations. To avoid conflict by attempting to keep myth and history entirely separate may not be possible because the two interpenetrate. The most fruitful approach to the problem might be to work towards a dialectical resolution.},

We trace this development through the post-colonial period, examining how archaeology and ancient history are practiced and conceptualized today. We conclude with four case studies that explore the existing state of, and the potential for, productive partnerships between historians and archaeologists. /// L'{\'e}tude du pass{\'e}e historique, {\`a}travers l'evidence material et documentaire, faisait partie int{\'e}grante du pratique colonial a l'Inde, et reste encore un foyer du gouvernement et de la publique de la sud-Asie contemporaine.
