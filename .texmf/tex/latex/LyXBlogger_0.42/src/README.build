# USING COALESCE.PY
---------------------------------------------------------------
C R E D I T S

The following files:
    coalesce.py
    make

and the following folders:
    io
    util

are the work of Alex Fern√°ndez, the creator of eLyXer.
For more information, see www.nongnu.org/elyxer.

As eLyXer is also released under the GNU General
Public License v3, we will use it. Thanks, Alex!

A couple of notes on using the coalesce library to turn a modular
system into an executable:

1. When one file in a package calls another file in the same
package, coalesce.py requires that the second file be called
from its full package address, not its local relative. For
example, if there are two source files in Package_A:

     file_1.py
     file_2.py

Then from within file_1.py, to use file_2.py, you must import it like this:

     import Package_A.file_2


You will get a "file not found" error if you import it like this:

     import file_2

Even though that normally works in Python.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
M A K E

To create the executable, simply run ./make from this folder.


The other quirk to be aware of is that coalesce.py must be in your src
directory. That is, in the same directory as the main file you are
going to turn into a standalong executable, and also the same directory
where your package folders reside.
