#   This program allows you to post to your WordPress blog right from  #
#   LyX.                                                               #

#   LyXBlogger is hosted at lyxblogger.nongnu.org.                 #

#   Complete documentation for LyXBlogger is available at              #
#   http://lyxblogger.nongnu.org.                                      #

#   Alternatively, you can generate the html docs from the original    #
#   LyX files, which are located in lyxblogger/docs/raw.               #
#                                                                      #
#   Or, if you downloaded this package directly from                   #
#   http://lyxblogger.nongnu.org, as opposed to git-cloning it     #
#   from github, the generated docs are already in the package at      #
#   lyxblogger-XX/docs/*.html.                                         #
