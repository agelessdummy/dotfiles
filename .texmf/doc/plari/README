This is the 19981102 release of plari.cls
-----------------------------------------

The document class plari is meant for typesetting stageplay scripts.
It is under active development so the visual appearance of the typeset
result and the class user interface will probably change over time, as
the document class is updated.

The name `plari' is (at least where I've associated with theatre
people) Finnish theatre jargon for the physical pile of paper that
contains a stageplay script.
