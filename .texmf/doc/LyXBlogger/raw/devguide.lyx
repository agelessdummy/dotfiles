\begin_layout Section
The Basics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document should help you get started if you want to understand how
 LyXBlogger works, and maybe extending its functionality.
 The package (including this guide and all accompanying materials) is licensed
 under the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "GPL version 3"
target "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html"

\end_inset

 or, at your option, any later version.
 See the 
\family typewriter
LICENSE
\family default
 file for details.
 Also visit the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "main page"
target "index.html"

\end_inset

 to find out about the latest developments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this first section we will outline how LyXBlogger performs the basic
 tasks.
 Next section will be devoted to more arcane matters.
 The third section deals with future planned extensions, and the fourth
 one includes things that will probably 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 be implemented.
 Finally there is a FAQ that contains answers to questions asked privately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Getting LyXBlogger
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are interested in LyXBlogger from a developer perspective the first
 thing to do is fetch the code.
 It is included in the standard distribution, so just navigate to the 
\family typewriter
src/
\family default
 folder and take a look at the 
\family typewriter
.py
\family default
 Python code files.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Advanced Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Unit Testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each file in src/LyxBlog/ has a file of unit tests to run.
 The file 'test_seed.py' will run all the tests, but here is an example of
 how to invoke just one of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cd lyxblogger/src/LyxBlog
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
python handle_exceptions.py
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this test, it's testing out the exception screen, so if it looks like
 it broke, hit ENTER three times, and the test should pass ok.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also note that you must 'cd' to the same directory the test is in, or else
 it won't be able to find the test files to upload.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To run all the tests together,
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cd lyxblogger/src/LyxBlog
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
python handle_exceptions.py
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And remember to hit ENTER three times to get past the exception test screens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And finally, yes, you do need an internet connection to run the tests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Test Caveats
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
image_test.py
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Must be run from the same directory as the file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
interact_test.py
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You have to interact with it.
 Hit enter when it gives you the option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Running seed.py 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to debug LyXBlogger then it is better to run it from the source
 code folder, instead of the compiled version.
 For this you need to make just a small change, instead of 
\family typewriter
INSTALL/lyxblogger.py 
\family default
run 
\family typewriter
src/seed.py
\family default
.
 On GNU/Linux or Mac OS X this file can be run as an executable like so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
./seed.py [input_file] --run-here
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The --run-here flag prevents src/term.py from calling the lyxblogger module
 in an xterm window.
 This means that everything that's executed will be done on local files,
 without the use of the lyxblogger module that may be installed on your
 system.
 This is much easier to develop on for most things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Interactive Testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a test file in src/ called test_seed.py.
 This file calls all the unit tests, and then begins an interative test
 where seed.py will be invoked to talk to the server with automated responses
 given.
 Make sure you are connected to the internet when you run this test, or
 the test will appear to just run off the screen.
 If interactive_test.py is not working, first get seed.py to run with the
 '--run-here' option.
 Once seed.py is running with '--run-here', then go back to debugging interactive
_test.py.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the test you are working with is not finishing, comment out the other
 tests in interactivee_test.py so the test suite can finish and show you
 the results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
print vs pr3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
pr3 is used in LyXBlogger to enable messages to be passed back and forth
 between the interactive LyXBlogger and the interactive tester.
 Anything that must be passed to the interactive tester must use pr3.
 Anything else can use a regular print() statement.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Unicode Strings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
print() and pr3() don't always play nicely with strings.
 This happens most often when using the interactive tester.
 Hence, some lines that are particularly problematic have been wrapped in
 a try: clause looking for a UnicodeEncodeError exception.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Distribution 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will notice that in the 
\family typewriter
src/LyXBlog
\family default
 folder there are several Python files, while in the INSTALL directory there
 is just a big one.
 The reason is that before distributing the source code is coalesced and
 placed on the main directory, so that users can run it without worrying
 about libraries, directories and the such.
 (They need of course to have Python 2.4, 2.5, or 2.6 installed.) And the weapon
 is a little Python script called 
\family typewriter
coalesce.py
\family default
 that does the dirty job of parsing dependencies and inserting them into
 the main file.
 There is also a 
\family typewriter
make
\family default
 Bash script that takes care of permissions and generates the documentation.
 Just type
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 ./distribute.py
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
at the prompt.
 It is a primitive way perhaps to generate the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

binary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (ok, not really a binary but a distributable Python file), but it works
 great.
 It also runs all of the included tests to check that no functionality has
 been lost from one release to the next -- although some issues in a feature
 can slip undetected if there is no test for them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
./distribute.py also invokes test_seed.py to validate that all the tests are
 passing before creating the binary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the moment there is no way to do this packaging on non-Unix operating
 systems with a single script, e.g.
 a Windows 
\family typewriter
.bat
\family default
 script.
 However the steps themselves are trivial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are willing to send a patch to the LyXBlogger mailing list then you
 should patch against the proper sources in 
\family typewriter
src/
\family default
 and submit that to the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "mailing list"
target "lyxblogger-users@nongnu.org"
type "mailto:"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
License and Contributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyXBlogger is published under the GPL, version 3 or later 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "stallman-gplv3"

\end_inset

.
 This basically means that you can modify the code and distribute the result
 as desired, as long as you publish your modifications under the same license.
 But consult a lawyer if you want an authoritative opinion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All contributions will be published under this same license, so if you send
 them this way you implicitly give your consent.
 An explicit license grant would be even better and may be required for
 larger contributions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Important Tidbits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Calling Python Modules as Scripts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "this link"
target "http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0338/"

\end_inset

 on calling python modules as scripts with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

python -m <module>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 syntax.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Testing a Release
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considerable unit testing and some interactive testing has been added to
 the code.
 But to ensure quality release code, the following tests are suggested before
 publishing a new release.
 Run then on GNU/Linux and on Windows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Upload a document with at least one picture and a title using eLyXer using
 AUTO_LOGIN
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Upload a document with at least one picture and a title using LyXHTML where
 you type in your url explicitly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Upload a document using eLyXer that has no title.
 Make sure it asks for a title and uses it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Upload a document using LyXHTML that has no title.
 Make sure it asks for a title and uses it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Future Extensions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author has plans for the following extensions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Republish
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ability to correct changes in the original LyX file, publish the post,
 and have the new entry overwrite a previous entry instead of being posted
 as a new entry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Download and Edit Previous Entries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author would love to have a bidirectional method in place for editing
 and republishing blog entries.
 The biggest question seems to be, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What converter will provide xhtml -> LyX conversion the best?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Display UTF-8 Titles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Correctly display UTF-8 titles on Windows machines.
 Works fine on GNU/Linux, but other characters show up on Windows.
 Either way, the entry is posted perfectly, it just looks funny in the LyXBlogge
r console window.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Select Multiple Categories
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ability to select two or more categories for a single blog entry.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
GUI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A graphical user interface where the user can select previously posted blog
 entries, edit them, push the changes to the server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Page Creation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ability to create a WordPress page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Roadmap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Who needs a map? A map would be nice, actually, but there isn't one.
 Feel free to suggest one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Discarded Bits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not everything that has been planned or can be done with LyXBlogger is planned;
 some extensions have been discarded.
 However, this means basically that the author is too ignorant to know how
 to do them right; help (and patches!) towards a sane implementation would
 be welcome if they fit with the design.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
FAQ
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: I don't like how LyXBlogger outputs my document, what can I do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: First make sure that you are using the proper CSS file, i.e.
 copy the existing 
\family typewriter
docs/lyx.css
\family default
 file to your blog's server.
 Next try to customize the CSS file to your liking; it is a flexible approach
 that requires no code changes.
 Also consider trying both supported converters, as each one puts out somewhat
 different-looking output.
 If all else fails, try changing the LyXBlogger code and submitting the
 patch back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: Why does your Python code suck so much? You don't make proper use of
 most features!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: Because I'm mostly a novice with little Python culture.
 If you want to help it suck less, please send mail and enlighten me.
