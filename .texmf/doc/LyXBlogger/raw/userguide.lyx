The Basics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyXBlogger (pronounced 
\emph on
licks blogger
\emph default
) is a blog publishing tool.
 It doesn't walk your dog, insult your mother, or assert world peace.
 But it does make composing and uploading blog entries simple and straightforwar

System Requirements--Client
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The computer that LyXBlogger is installed on will be referred to as the
 
\emph on

\emph default
machine.
 This is likely the same computer that you use to compose your LyX documents
 and to convert them to xhtml.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Required:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Python version between 2.4 and 2.6.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
(Python 3.1 will be supported once the xmlrpclib module is ported to it.)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Python 2.7.2 (full installs) seem to work on Windows, but Python 2.7.0 on Linux
 is still throwing errors for the developer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LyX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A LyX -> xhtml converter (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 installed)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Special Notes about Windows Installs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The popular way to install LyX on Windows is to use the binary installer
 available at 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "http://www.lyx.org/Download"
target "http://www.lyx.org/Download"

\end_inset

.
 This will install Python onto your system, but it may not work with LyXBlogger.
 To check it out, open python by typing 
\emph on
python
\emph default
 at the command prompt.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
c:
\backslash
>python 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Python 2.7.2 (default, Jun 12 2011, 15:08:59) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on
 win 32 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
>>> import socket 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
>>>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If it imports the 
\emph on
socket
\emph default
 module with no errors, your python installation is fine.
 If, however, you get an error 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
ImportError: No module named _socket
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then you have a problem.
 The easy way around this is to rename your c:
\backslash
Program Files
\backslash
LyX20
\backslash
Python directory to something like c:
\backslash
Program Files
\backslash
LyX20
\backslash
Python_Renamed so that LyX won't use that install.
 Then proceed to 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "http://python.org/download/"
target "http://python.org/download/"

\end_inset

 and download and install the latest version of Python2.7.
 Open Control Panes -> Classic View ->System -> Advanced System Settings
 -> 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Advanced
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 tab -> Environment Variables.
 Open the one called 
\emph on
path
\emph default
 and append ;c:
\backslash
Python27 to the end of it (or wherever you installed Python.
 Then go on to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Installation"

\end_inset

 to install LyXBlogger.
 Once the LyXBlogger module is installed (under your new version of Python),
 reopen LyX, click Tools -> Reconfigure.
 Restart LyX, and if it's LyX 2.0 or later, 
\emph on
LyXBlogger
\emph default
 will automatically show up in your export menu.

System Requirements--Server 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The computer that WordPress is installed on will be referred to as the 
\emph on
server
\emph default
, since WordPress is often installed on a remote server.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Required:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
WordPress
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WordPress can be installed on most web servers that support PhP and MySQL.
 Many web hosting companies even offer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of WordPress.
 For more information on installing WordPress on your site, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "wordpress.org"
target "http://codex.wordpress.org/Hosting_WordPress"

\end_inset

.
 Also check the documentation for your particular web server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to blog without the hassle of setting up the WordPress software
 yourself, you can sign up for a 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "wordpress.com"
target "http://www.wordpress.com"

\end_inset

 hosted blog.
 If you go this route, I recommend paying the small fee (about $10/year)
 for the ability to modify your own CSS file.
 That way you can customize the look and feel of your entries.

xhtml Converters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An xhtml converter is required as an intermediate step between LyX and your
 WordPress blog.
 You may use eLyXer, which comes bundled with LyXBlogger, or you may use
 LyX 2.0's native LyXHTML converter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

Installation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First you will need to fetch the official distribution file from the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "download area"
target "https://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=lyxblogger"

\end_inset

.
 Start by uncompressing the distributed file to a suitable directory.
 Just write at the command prompt
\begin_inset Foot

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This default installation includes wordpresslib and eLyXer.
 To install without affecting your current eLyXer installation, you may
 use the alternate installer, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$ python setup-no-elyxer.py install
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sub:Command-Line-Usage"

\end_inset

Command-Line Usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyXBlogger is generally used from the export menu of LyX.
 (To set up your export menu, see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:LyX-Integration"

\end_inset

.) However, at its roots LyXBlogger is perfectly happy being called from
 the command line.
 To invoke LyXBlogger from the command line, first generate xhtml by previewing
 LyXHTML from LyX 2.0, or by either previewing or manually invoking eLyXer.
 Then change to the directory where the xhtml file resides.
 The location is shown in your browser window when you preview.
 Invoke LyXBlogger as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$ python -m lyxblogger <input_file> 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Test-Drive"

\end_inset

Test Drive
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyXBlogger comes out of the box ready to upload to a test site (blogtest.twomorelines.com) where you can test its posting capability.
 LyXBlogger will ask you whether to post to the test site or not.
 Once you can post to the test site, just run LyXBlogger again, this time
 telling it to use a different site instead.
 It will prompt you for your domain name, user name, and password.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Profiles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
New in version 0.38 is the ability to save several profiles.
 LyXBlogger comes out of the box with a profile called test@blogtest.twomorelines.com.
 Anyone may post to this blog.
 It's for practicing.
 Then once you get the hang of how LyXBlogger works, add your own profile
 to the list and post to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Password Prompt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most secure method is to enter an empty password.
 This method does not save your password--you will be prompted to type it
 in each time you make a post.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Image Uploads
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HTML pages do not contain images, as PDF documents; rather they have pointers
 to image locations on disk.
 (Luckily LyX documents are the same in this respect.) LyXBlogger will find
 all the image tags in your xhtml document and upload them one by one to
 your blog site.
 Thus far JPG images have been tested.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:LyX-Integration"

\end_inset

LyX Integration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may choose to use LyXBlogger solely from the command line.
 But it is often more convenient to set up LyXBlogger as a converter inside
 LyX so that you can just click a couple buttons when you are ready to upload
 your content.
 Then LyX automatically generates the xhtml for you using your selected
 xhtml converter, copies the xhtml file and any associated image files to
 a temporary directory, and uses those files when invoking LyXBlogger.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
LyXBlogger with LyX 1.6.x 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you used the standard installation of LyXBlogger, eLyXer is already installed
 on your system as a Python module.
 To set up LyX to use the eLyXer xhtml format when using LyXBlogger, use
 these standard options in your converter line: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Converter: python -m elyxer --nofooter --directory $$r $$i $$o
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For more information about eLyXer, see http://www.nongnu.org/elyxer/.
 Next you need to find out what your eLyXer output format is called in LyX.
 By default LyX calls it simply html.
 So as long as you haven't changed it, that's what it will still be called.
 Now go to 
\emph on
Tools-> Preferences-> File Handling-> File Formats
\emph default
.
 Create a new file format.
 Give it a descriptive name like 
\emph on
LyXBlogger (eLyXer)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Make sure you check Document Format.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Short name: blog 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Extension: blog 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then click on Converters and define a new converter as follows: (This assumes
 that the format produced by eLyXer is still set to the default of "html")
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
From_Format: HTML 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
To_Format: LyXBlogger (eLyXer)
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Converter: python -m lyxblogger $$i
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now you can invoke this converter from within LyX by clicking 
\emph on
File-> Export-> LyXBlogger (eLyXer)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
LyXBlogger with LyX 2.0.x 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX 2.0 comes with LyXHTML support already built in.
 Once you have installed LyXBlogger, open LyX 2.0 and click 
\emph on
Tools -> Reconfigure
\emph default
.
 Then restart LyX.
 LyX should have detected that LyXBlogger is installed and automatically
 set up the file format and converter for you.
 Click File -> Export-> LyXBlogger.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Using eLyXer with LyXBlogger and LyX 2.0
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In LyX 2.0, LyXBlogger comes preconfigured to use the internal LyXHTML format.
 The other format supported is eLyXer xhtml format.
 If you used the standard installation of LyXBlogger, eLyXer is already
 installed on your system as a Python module.
 To use eLyXer instead of LyXHTML:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Open LyX 2.0 and go to 
\emph on
Tools-> Preferences-> External Formats -> Converters.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Select the converter named 
\emph on
LyXHTML to LyXBlogger
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Grab the 
\emph on
From Format
\emph default
 drop-down menu where 
\emph on
LyXHTML
\emph default
 is showing, and select 
\emph on
HTML
\emph default
 instead.
 (This assumes that your eLyXer format is still called HTML in LyX, which
 it is by default.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Click 
\emph on
Add
\emph default
 and then 
\emph on
Apply
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Highlight the original 
\emph on
LyXHTML to LyXBlogger
\emph default
 converter again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Remove it by clicking 
\emph on
Remove
\emph default
, and then 
\emph on
Save
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Click 
\emph on
Tools -> Reconfigure
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Restart LyX.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Run LyXBlogger again by clicking 
\emph on
File -> Export -> LyXBlog
\emph default
ger.
 When LyXBlogger opens it will tell you it is using the eLyXer format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Interface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
LyXBlogger
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the welcome screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Format
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This explains which format was detected, and tells you what the other options
 are, so no format is left behind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Title
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you tag a line in your document as the title, LyXBlogger uses that as
 your posting title.
 If no title was detected, LyXBlogger will ask you to provide one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cut Flag
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cut flag is a feature which allows you to put things end of your LyX document
 that will not be included in your post.
 That way, you don't have to delete all your thoughts and musings from the
 document -- you can keep them in your working copy without publishing them.
 If a cut flag is found, it will tell you so.
 If you thought you defind a cut flag, and it says it's not found-- double
 check how you defined it to make sure your extra notes are not included
 in your post.
 The test site is good for trying this out, too, since if you make a mistake
 there, it's not so obvious to the world.
 If you don't get the cut flag right the first time, you can always re-post
 it later when you figure it out.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default cut flag is defined in the USER DEFINED VARIABLES section of
 the code.
 :
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
CUT_FLAG = '#! CUT MATERIAL'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's what's inside the single quotations that counts.
 So with the default cut flag, the next paragraph will be found as the cut
 flag.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
#! CUT MATERIAL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See how the single quotes are gone? Note the single space between '!' and
 'C' and between 'T' and 'M'? See how the cut flag is at the beginning of
 a paragraph? That will be picked up as a valid cut flag, and everything
 I write down here below it will not be posted.
 I can tell all the funny jokes I want down here and no one will ever read
 them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to change what is recognized as a cut flag, just edit lyxblogger.py
 and run
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
python setup.py install
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
again from the INSTALL directory.
 On GNU/Linux this must be run as a super user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Domain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This asks you where you want to post to.
 The default is to the test site.
 If you type 'N', you will be asked where you want to post to.
 If you want to change what site your LyXBlogger posts to by default, just
 edit lyxblogger.py and run
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
python setup.py install
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
again from the INSTALL directory.
 On GNU/Linux this must be run as a super user.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
New or Existing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
New means you've never posted this document before.
 Existing means you already posted this document, but now you've made a
 few changes to in and you want to replace the version that's currently
 on the server with your latest changes.
 If you type 'E' for Existing, you are provided with a short list of up
 to nine recent posts to choose from.
 If you are updating an existing post from further back than that, use the
 'A' option to bring in all your previous posts.
 This can take some time, depending on your internet connection.
 On fairly fast connection, with about 200 posts on the server, it takes
 my system about 30 seconds to bring these in.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Category
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The categories brought in are ones already set up in your blog.
 LyXBlogger is expecting a numerical input.
 If you type out the whole name of the title, if will ask to type it in
 again.
 To add additional categories to the list, log in to your wordpress site
 using your web browser and add them there.
 Then LyXBlogger can pick them up.

Images
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before the post is published, each image in your LyX document is uploaded
 to the wordpres server.
 This may come as a surprise, but the bigger the image (in MegaBytes), the
 longer it takes to upload the image.
 The connectivity speed of your server plays a role here, as well.
 If it's taking a long time, try posting to the test site at blogtest.twomorelines.com to compare upload speed.

Advanced Use
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some advanced uses for eLyXer if you want to extract the most
 of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Delay
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the DELAY parameter in USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES just puts a small pause in
 after the Copyright information displays.
 This gives the user a chance to read it.
 If you've already read it once, you can change it to 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
DELAY = 0
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Capital or Lowercase
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anytime LyXBlogger asks for a response, such as 'Y' for Yes, either an uppercase
 or lowercase response will do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What do the Parentheses Mean? (Y) N
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This format means the one in parentheses will be selected if you press ENTER.
\end_layout

Command Line Options
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Running in Same Window
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, you can also run LyXBlogger without spawning
 a separate xterm window.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\family typewriter
\color blue
$
\color inherit
 python -m lyxblogger [source file] --run-here
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Unsupported eLyXer options
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eLyXer has an option called 
\emph on
--html
\emph default
.
 It causes eLyXer to output html instead of xhtml.
 Basically this means that it will not include closing tags.
 LyXBlogger is specifically looking for opening and closing tags in order
 to locate the title of your document.
 Therefore, the --html option is not supported.
\end_layout

CSS
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The look of your blog entries when you publish from LyXBlogger is entirely
 dependent on your CSS style file.
 If you are using eLyXer, a good starting place is to copy the eLyXer CSS
 file from http://www.nongnu.org/elyxer/lyx.css.
 It comes with sane defaults for getting your site going.
 Then you can tweak it as you go along to get a customized look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are using LyXHTML format, you can build your own CSS style by first
 copying the embedded CSS styles.
 Just preview the LyXHTML, then from your browser click View-> Source Code.
 Copy all the CSS info to your own CSS file, and then edit to your liking.
 Since LyXHTML automatically wraps all paragraphs in an <a> tag, I recommend
 changing it so that each paragraph doesn't underline itself when you mouseover
 it.
 This can be as simple as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
a:hover{
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    text-decoration: none;
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Title
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a title is found in your LyX document, it will be used as your blog entry's
 title.
 If one is not found, you will be prompted to enter one.
 By default eLyXer adds a title for you if you didn't put one in.
 It is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Converted Document
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This auto-generated title will be ignored, and you will be prompted for
 a proper title.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Work on LyXBlogger began in early 2010, has been gaining features as the
 months roll by.
 It's still a work in progress, whose future depends largely on the tastes
 of those that use it.
 If you have suggestions for improving LyXBlogger, make them!

FAQ
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: What versions of LyX, Python, and operating systems are supported?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: It has been tested with LyX versions 1.6.4, 1.6.5, and 2.0.0.
 It has been tested with eLyXer version 0.41, 0.42, and 1.04.
 It has been tested with Python version 2.4 and 2.6.
 (Python 2.7.2 on Windows also works if it's a full install, but Python 2.7.0
 on Ubuntu is not working yet).
 It has been tested on Ubuntu 9.10, Mac OS X and Windows Vista 32-bit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: There are indeed 
\emph on
a ton
\emph default
 of blogging clients over the web.
 Why add another one?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: Because none of them allow composition from LyX.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: I don't like how LyXBlogger outputs my document, what can I do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: First make sure that you are using an appropriate CSS file.
 i.e.
 copy the existing 
\family typewriter
docs/lyx.css
\family default
 file to your blog's server.
 Next try to customize the CSS file to your liking; it is a flexible approach
 that requires no code changes.
 Also consider trying both supported converters, as each one puts out somewhat
 different-looking output.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: Why are only LyXHTML and eLyXer formats supported?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: Other formats were tested in the early development stages of LyXBlogger.
 Namely 
\emph on
HeVea
\emph default
, 
\emph on
TtH
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
latex2html
\emph default
.
 Basically, it was simplest to find one or two formats that worked well
 and only support them.
 Perhaps future versions will support additional formats if users ask for
 it enough.
 Here is a rundown of features I liked and didn't like about the formats
 I tried:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Supported: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
LyXHTML: Good support for footnotes.
 Built in to future versions of LyX.
 Integration is simple.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
eLyXer: Good support for footnotes.
 Very easy to get a working CSS file together which takes care of all usage
 scenarios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Unsupported:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
HeVeA Manages to insert a bunch of extra ’br’ tags into the html which makes
 the right edge all raggedy.
 And the numbered list issue is also that there’s an extra ’br’ tag inside
 the first item in each list, which looks weird.The four tools supported
 by LyX (tex4ht, HeVeA, TtH and latex2html) gave inferior results a couple
 of years ago, and were quite inflexible.
 The author found the need for a good converter, while at the same time
 acknowledging the difficulty of the problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
LaTeX2Html This rendition is quite sophisticated, and it ultimately makes
 one little blog into a multiple page linked document.
 Nice for some things, but not what I was after.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
TtH: Works quite well, and could be easily incorporated into LyXBlogger,
 but it does put footnotes at the bottom of the blog, where readers are
 unlikely to recognize them as footnotes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: Why did you leave out my favorite feature 
\emph on
<insert random LyX command here>
\emph default
?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: In short, because nobody asked for it.
 Usually it is better to first aim for your own needs and what others request,
 and then worry about supporting everything, or you will never get anything
 done.
 Just let the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "author"
target "mailto:JackDesert@gmail.com"
type "mailto:"

\end_inset

 know what features you would like to see added.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: Is there a mailing list? I need help with installation / configuration.

name "LyXBlogger test site"
target "http://blogtest.twomorelines.com"

\end_inset

, which is what LyXBlogger will try to do anyway until you change this default
 behavior.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: Why does LyXBlogger take a long time to open when used with large documents?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
A: Most of that time is waiting for the xhtml converter to run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Q: Where can I get the latest documentation and information about LyXBlogger?
