</h1>
<div class="Standard">
LyX really is a new way of thinking about documents. There is a bit of a learning curve about it, but once you get the formatting set up the way you want it, each successive chapter in your book sets up exactly the same-- automatically. It also prevents you from doing things that don’t normally make sense, like putting two spaces between a word, or a space at the beginning of a paragraph. It won’t even let you accidentally (or on purpose) put two blank lines between paragraphs. Content is content and layout is layout - and LyX does a good job keeping them separate.
</div>
<div class="Standard">
So many of us have become LyX addicts for these and other reasons. But when one wants to publish to the web, as in creating an online blog, there comes a dilemma of the having your cake and eating it too variety. Of course LyX users still want to compose everything they do in LyX. But blogging engines, such as WordPress, don’t speak LyX, and they don’t understand PDF either. They hunger for none other than xhtml. Ah, but how to get your beautiful looking, carefully arranged document from LyX to WordPress, while retaining your document’s organization and allowing you to still manage your own CSS style file to tweak the formatting?
</div>
<div class="Standard">
LyX die-hards have done it the hard way before. Like composing a document in LyX, then copying the screen into the blog engine composition window, and re-adding any formatting that was lost for titles, headings, emphasis, lists, and so on. Well those days are over. Now you can talk directly from LyX to your favorite blogging engine. That is, as long as your favorite blogging engine is WordPress. 
</div>
<h1 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--3"></a>Solution
</h1>
<div class="Standard">
LyXBlogger allows you to post to your WordPress blog right from LyX. Recent versions include the following features:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
Invokes the html converter of your choice (eLyXer and LyXHTML supported)
</li>
<li>
Uploads images and text directly to your blog
</li>
<li>
Remembers credentials from multiple blog sites
</li>
<li>
Allows you to either create new posts or update older ones
</li>
<li>
Preserves the document hierarchy as CSS classes, which you can style with a master stylesheet for consistent look across your blog.
</li>
<li>
Provides a test site (blogtest.twomorelines.com) where you can try out LyXBlogger without polluting your own blog. 
</li>
