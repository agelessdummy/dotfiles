<center><b>How to change the MARGINS</b></center>

<p><pre>LaTeX's margins are, by default, 1.5 inches wide on 12pt documents,
1.75 inches wide on 11pt documents, and 1.875 inches wide on 10pt
documents.  This is the standard for book margins.  If you want to
change it to the standard 1 inch margins on all sides, you can use the
&quot;fullpage&quot; package.  You do this by including the line

	 \usepackage{fullpage}

after your \documentclass line.  

If you want to change your margins to something else, you can change the
values yourself.  For example, here's the commands you would use to change all
the margins to 1 inch manually:

	\addtolength{\oddsidemargin}{-.875in}
	\addtolength{\evensidemargin}{-.875in}
	\addtolength{\textwidth}{1.75in}

	\addtolength{\topmargin}{-.875in}
	\addtolength{\textheight}{1.75in}

These commands would be used after the \usepackage and before the
\begin{document} commands.

The idea for these commands is to decrease the margin on one side then
increase the text size by double that decreased amount, thereby decreasing
both the left and right margins (or top and bottom in the second group of
commands) by the same amount.

The \oddsidemargin and the \evensidemargin are both changed because LaTeX has
two side margins, one for odd pages and one for even pages.

There is another option that you can use to change the margins, which is
much simpler.  It involves copying a LaTeX style file to your directory.
Assuming that your files are in the directory ~/latex, type:

	attach sipb
	cp /mit/sipb/share/tex/macros/simplemargins.sty ~/latex

Then add a line saying

     \usepackage{simplemargins}

after your \documentclass line.

After doing this you should be able to use the following commands to
specify the margins:

	\setleftmargin{dimen}
	\setrightmargin{dimen}
	\settopmargin{dimen}
	\setbottommargin{dimen}
	\setallmargins{dimen}

The first four commands should be obvious -- the set the dimension of
just one margin.  The last one sets all of them to the same thing.  To
set all your margins to 1 inch you would use:

	\setallmargins{1in}

NOTE: This is a hack!  It will only work at MIT, so if you want to send
a file with these commands to someone, either send the file
simplemargins.sty with it or don't use it at all.
