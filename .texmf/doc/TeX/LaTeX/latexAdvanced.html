If you want to include         graphics, coloured text or source code from a file into your document,         you need to enhance the capabilities of LATEX. Such enhancements are called         packages. Packages are activated with the</p>      <p class="MenuBoxSelection">\usepackage[options]{package} </p>      <p>command, where package is the name of the package and options is a list         of<br>        keywords that trigger special features in the package. Almost all packages         are provided<br>        separately from CTAN.org repository. Packages standard to the LaTeX2E         distribution are marked with an asterix.</p>      <h3>Commonly Used Packages</h3>      <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>           <td width="21%">Name</td>          <td width="79%">Description</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td><div align="center">babel*</div></td>          <td>Write in multiple languages in one document, correct hyphenation             for each language, translations for document elements, and commands             for easy type input are provided.</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td><div align="center">multicol*</div></td>          <td>Easily make just a section of text multiple columns.</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td><div align="center">amslatex</div></td>          <td>The American Mathematical Society's official math package</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td><div align="center">textcomp</div></td>          <td>Enables special symbols like degree, the euro, and others</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td><div align="center">longtable</div></td>          <td>Multi-page tables.</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td>&nbsp;</td>          <td>&nbsp;</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td>&nbsp;</td>          <td>&nbsp;</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td>&nbsp;</td>          <td>&nbsp;</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td>&nbsp;</td>          <td>&nbsp;</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td>&nbsp;</td>          <td>&nbsp;</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td>&nbsp;</td>          <td>&nbsp;</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td>&nbsp;</td>          <td>&nbsp;</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td>&nbsp;</td>          <td>&nbsp;</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td>&nbsp;</td>          <td>&nbsp;</td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <h2>Document Types<a name="doc"></a></h2>      <p>The first command in any LaTeX file determines the format for the entire         document. </p>      <p align="center"><strong>\documentclass[<em>options</em>] {<em>class</em>}</strong></p>      <p align="left">You can either use one of the four standard latex classes,         book, report, article, or letter, or a contributed class designed by an         individual and contributed to the CTAN.org archive. A good example of         a custom class is the Reed Thesis Template.</p>      <h3>Book<a name="book"></a></h3>      <p>This is the most complex class. Unlike the report class, the book class         treats odd and even pages differently and prints the chapter or section         title on each page in the header. If you are creating a document with         many chapters or want it to look like a professional book, you should         use the book class. If you find the book class too limiting, you may want         to use the memoir class. </p>      <h3>Report<a name="report"></a></h3>      <p>A report may have chapters. It is a less complicated version of the book         class, often used for theses and other short multi-chapter documents.         The Reed Thesis Template is based on the Report class.</p>      <h3>Article<a name="article"></a></h3>      <p>The article class is perfect for papers and journal articles. It puts         the title, author, and date on the first page and starts the main body         of text on the same page. This class does not allow chapters, but does         allow parts, sections, and subsections.</p>      <h3>Resumes<a name="resume"></a></h3>      <p>Many LaTeX users have created custom resume classes. By searching Google         for &quot;latex resume&quot;, you can find a large number of varying designs         and styles, including academic CVs and professional resumes. Follow the         directions accompanying whatever resume you choose to use.</p>      <h3>Letters&nbsp;<a name="letter"></a></h3>      <p>LaTeX provides a build-in letter class that will quickly and easily produce         a professional and well-designed letter. You must include the sender's         address and name with the following commands in every letter.</p>      <p align="center"><strong>\address{<em>sender_address</em>}</strong></p>      <p align="center"><strong>\signature{<em>sender_name</em>}</strong> or <strong>\name{<em>sender_name</em>}</strong></p>      <p align="left">The sender_address normally consists of several lines, separated         by \\ commands. If you want a different signature then the sender name,         you should use the both \name command in the preamble and the \signature         command.</p>      <p align="left">Your main message should go between the following commands:</p>      <p align="center"><strong>\begin{letter}{<em>recipient</em>}</strong></p>      <p align="center"><strong>\end{letter}</strong></p>      <p align="left">where recipient stands for the name and address of whoever         the letter is going to, divided into several lines by the \\ command.         You will also need to use the </p>      <p align="center"><strong>\opening{<em>dear</em>}</strong></p>      <p align="center"><strong>\closing{<em>regards</em>}</strong></p>      <p align="left">in the body of the text, where appropriate (usually at the         start and end of the letter), to set the salutation and terminating text,         where dear is the salutation, such as Dear Barbara, and regards is the         closing text, such as Sincerely.</p>      <h2>Lists<a name="lists"></a></h2>      <p>LaTeX provides three standard list styles: description, enumerate, and         itemize. You can also customize the List environment yourself, but this         is quite difficult. </p>      <h3>Description</h3>      <p>This list provides a definition list, or a single word or character in         bold followed by the entry, as seen in the following example:</p>      <table width="100%" border="0">        <tr>           <td width="18%"><strong>Austria</strong></td>          <td width="82%">The Republic of Austria is a landlocked country in Central             Europe, a federation of nine states. Austria is bordered by Germany             and the Czech Republic to the north, Slovakia and Hungary to the east,             Slovenia and Italy to the south, and Switzerland and Liechtenstein             to the west.</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td><strong>Luxembourg</strong> </td>          <td>The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (also Luxemburg) is a landlocked country             in north-west Europe, bordered by France, Germany and Belgium.</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td><strong>Andorra</strong></td>          <td>Principality of Andorra is a very small landlocked principality             in southwestern Europe, located in the eastern Pyrenees mountains             between France and Spain. Once isolated it is currently a prosperous             country mainly because of tourism and its status as a tax haven.</td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>To produce the following example, you would use the following LaTeX:</p>      <p>\begin{description}<br>        \item[Austria ] The Republic of Austria is a landlocked country in Central         Europe, a federation of nine states.

Once isolated it is currently a prosperous country mainly         because of tourism and its status as a tax haven.<br>        \end{description}</p>      <h3>Enumerate</h3>      <p>Enumerate is LaTeX's numbered list environment.

You may have parts, chapters, sections, and subsections.         These sectioning commands take care of numbering, formatting the heading,         include the section in the table of contents, and put the section title         and number in the header at the top of the page. Each sectioning command         uses the same syntax:</p>      <p align="center">\section{<em>title</em>}</p>      <p align="left">If you want the table of contents entry to be different         from the section name (often because of length), you should use the following         command:</p>      <p align="center">\section[<em>TableOfContents_Entry</em>]{<em>title</em>}       </p>      <p align="left">If you want the section unnumbered, you should use the following         syntax:</p>      <p align="center">\section*{<em>title</em>} </p>      <p align="left">However this means it will not be in the table of contents.         If you need it in the table of contents, include the following line preceding         the sectioning command. </p>      <blockquote>         <blockquote>           <p align="left">% increment the counter so the sections are 1.1, 1.2             etc.<br>            \setcounter{chapter}{1}<br>            \chapter*{The First} %make the table of contents line manually<br>            \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{The First} % I dunno if you need this<br>            \chaptermark{The First} % set the headers manually<br>            \markboth{This is the leftside header}{This is the rightside header}</p>        </blockquote>      </blockquote>      <p align="left">The sectioning commands are slightly different for long         documents versus short documents.</p>      <table width="80%" border="0" align="center">        <tr>           <td><p align="center">Book and Report Classes</p>            <ul>              <li>\part</li>              <li>\chapter</li>              <li>\section</li>              <li>\subsection</li>              <li>\subsubsection</li>              <li>\paragraph</li>              <li>\subparagraph</li>            </ul></td>          <td><p align="center">Articles</p>            <ul>              <li>\part</li>              <li>\section</li>              <li>\subsection</li>              <li>\subsubsection</li>              <li>\paragraph</li>              <li>\subparagraph</li>            </ul></td>        </tr>      </table>      <h2>Just What Are All Those Files?<a name="files"></a></h2>      <p>You probably have noticed the profileration of files created by LaTeX         with every new document. All will have the same name as the new document,         but end with a different extension. Each file fulfills an important function         for LaTeX, so do not delete anything unless you know what you are doing.       </p>      <ul>        <li>Document.tex - This is the file where you actually write your paper           or thesis and will spend most of your time.</li>        <li>Document.pdf - After you typeset your document by pressing &quot;Latex&quot;,           any changes in your .tex will now appear in the final product, the .pdf           file.</li>        <li>Document.aux - This file stores information to support citations and           other parts of the bibliography.</li>        <li>Document.bib - This is the text file BibTeX uses to create your bibliography.</li>        <li>Document.bbl - This is the LaTeX version of your BibTeXed bibliography.           You can change small problems with your bibliography here. Remember           that any changes will be lost when you run BibTeX.</li>      </ul>      <p>You may see two other types of files when you use LaTeX. These files         are available from CTAN.org and expand the capabilities of LaTeX or BibTeX.</p>      <ul>        <li>Anything.sty - You will be able to use this file if you place it in           the same folder as your document or in LaTeX's root folder. It must           be included as a package in the .tex document by adding \usepackage{Anything}.</li>        <li>Anything.bst - This file extends BibTeX and changes how your bibliography           looks.</li>      </ul>      <h2>Multiple Columns<a name="multicol"></a></h2>      <p>You may need to use multiple columns (similar to what you see in a newspaper)         for a special page or for your entire document. You can either use LaTeX's         built-in support or a package called <span class="MenuBoxSelection">multicol</span>.         While <span class="MenuBoxSelection">multicol</span> can make only a page         multiple columns, LaTeX makes the entire document multiple columns.</p>      <p>If you want to use LaTeX, add <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">twocolumn</font>         option to the document class declaration as seen below:</p>      <blockquote>         <p>\documentclass[twocolumn]{article}</p>      </blockquote>      <p>You will have problems with any tables or graphics that are a page wide.         We recommend using the <span class="MenuBoxSelection">multicol</span>         package to eliminate as many problems as possible. Remember to include         <span class="MenuBoxSelection">multicol</span> as a package as described         in the<a href="package"> Using Packages</a> section. It will switch to         multiple columns without a page break before or after the multiple column         text. </p>      <blockquote>         <p>\begin{multicols}{<em>num_cols</em>}[<em>header text</em>][<em>pre_space</em>]           <br>          text in multiple columns <br>          \end{multicols}</p>      </blockquote>      <p>The required <em>num_cols</em> determines the number of columns of text.         The optional <em>header text </em>is printed in a single column along         the top of the multi-column text. The optional <em>pre_space</em> changes         the necessary amount of space left on a page to make the text start on         a new page. </p>      <h2>Comments<a name="comments"></a></h2>      <p>In LaTeX, you can easily add comments to your working copy without anything         appearing in the printed-out versions you will show your professor. Paragraphs         you know will need later, comments on what needs to be added or revised,         or pieces of text you don't want are perfect for comments. For large projects         like theses, experts advise saving every piece of text you write, as you         never know when that idea will become important. By commenting the text,         it will turn red and not appear in the pdf LaTeX creates. </p>      <p>You can comment text by placing a percent (%) sign in front of any text         you do not want to appear in the pdf. The remainder of the paragraph after         the % sign will turn red and not appear in the pdf. In TeXshop, you can         also select a piece of text and comment it out by going to the <span class="MenuBoxSelection">Format</span>         menu and selecting <span class="MenuBoxSelection">Comment</span>. To make         it appear in the pdf again, remove the percent sign or select the text         and got to the <span class="MenuBoxSelection">Format</span> menu and select         <span class="MenuBoxSelection">Uncomment</span>. </p>      <h2>Marginal Notes<a name="notes"></a></h2>      <p>LaTeX also you to create marginal notes, text appearing at the margins         of the main body. The Torah uses marginal notes for the commentary of         the main text, as well as many analyses and commentaries on standard texts.         You can also use the marginal note command to highlight changes in the         text with a vertical bar in the margin.</p>      <blockquote>         <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Using the marginal note \marginpar{This           \\ is a \\ margin- \\al note} is so much fun...</font></p>      </blockquote>      <p>You must include the manual line breaks (\\) because the marginal note         box is so small (less than an inch across). With such a small space, LaTeX         needs help breaking lines and figuring out hyphenation. You can place         a vertical bar next to the paragraph using the following command:</p>      <blockquote>         <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">\marginpar{\rule[-17.5mm]{1mm}{20mm}}</font></p>      </blockquote>      <h2>Making Space<a name="space"></a></h2>      <p>Adding vertical or horizontal space is a quick fix solution for space         problems. It should wait until the last second as adding or removing text         will often break the fix. We do not recommend it, unless it is absolutely         necessary as LaTeX generally has a reason for its layout choices. Remember         that LaTeX likes the width to be in metric units (1.5cm).</p>      <p>Vertical space:</p>      <blockquote>         <p>\vspace{<em>width</em>}</p>      </blockquote>      <p>Horizontal space: </p>      <blockquote>         <p>\hspace{<em>width</em>}</p>      </blockquote>      <h2>Fixing Bugs<a name="bugs"></a></h2>      <p>LaTeX will sometimes take one look at your code and spew out an endless         supply of errors. Here are a bunch of tips to get the problem fixed, so         you can keep on writing.</p>      <ol>        <li>If you get a whole bunch of error messages, go to the first one. Often,           one error will cause all the subsequent messages. If you fix the first           error, the other errors will often disappear.</li>        <li>The error has to be caused by something you added since it last ran           correctly. This is obvious, but it pays off to examine any new writing           for obvious errors (missing {, \, or misspelled commands).</li>        <li>Use the line numbers given by LaTeX to narrow down where the error           is. However, make sure to examine the line above and below it as LaTeX           can be slightly off. Under the Edit menu, use Line Number... to go to           the line number given by the error message.</li>        <li>If you believe there is no error, try pressing r to make LaTeX run           despite any errors. Problems with the layout or text are clear indications           that the error should not be ignored and found.</li>        <li>If all efforts to find the error fail, use the comment feature to           narrow down where the error is. The easiest way is to select half the           text between the begin and end document commands and comment it out.           If the error goes away, you know the problem is in the selected code.           If it still has the error, the problem is in the non-selected code.           Continue with this method of splitting the text until you narrow it           down to one line. Now closely examine every word and LaTeX and look           for forbidden characters like &amp; and other possible problems.</li>        <li>If this does not work, please come to CUS and ask for help. Ben Salzberg           has seen a lot of errors in his time and will probably be able to fix           it.</li>      </ol>      <h3>Typical Error Messages and their Solutions</h3>      <ul>        <li><strong>Extra alignment tab has been changed to \cr.</strong><br>          You have too many &amp;s in a row of a table or array or eqnarray.</li>        <li><strong> LaTeX Error: \begin{something} on input line line number           ended by \end{document}</strong><br>          You've left out the \end{whatever}. Perhaps you're building a table           or an eqnarray that has a bunch of lines and you've forgotten the \end           statement.</li>        <li><strong> LaTeX Warning: Reference ... undefined on ...</strong><br>          You have references in your document. You need to compile again so will           be able to get the references right.</li>        <li><strong> LaTeX Warning: There were undefined references.</strong><br>          You have references in your document. You need to compile again so will           be able to get the references right.</li>        <li><strong> Missing $ inserted</strong><br>          You left out a $ or \[ or \] or $$ somewhere. when you were writing           text that needs to be in math mode.</li>        <li><strong> Paragraph ended before \end was complete.</strong><br>          You are probably missing an } at the end of an \end{something} statement.</li>        <li><strong> Runaway argument?</strong><br>          A runaway argument occurs when you leave off a }.</li>        <li><strong> Undefined control sequence.</strong><br>          You've tried to call a command that doesn't exist. Usually this is the           result of a typo. Go to the line number mentioned in the error and look           at all your commands. You'll probably find something like \rfac where           you wanted \frac.</li>      </ul>      <h2>Split Documents into Separate Files<a name="split"></a></h2>      <p>When you have a large document like a thesis, you often want to work         on only one chapter at a time. Your latex file may become incredibly long         and difficult to find individual paragraphs or parts of a chapter. If         this sounds like a problem you have, you may want to split each chapter         into individual files, using the following command:</p>      <blockquote>         <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">\include{filename}</font></p>      </blockquote>      <p>If you only want to see one or two chapters in the final pdf, you can         tell LaTeX to include those files only using the command</p>      <blockquote>         <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">\includeonly{file list}</font></p>      </blockquote>      <p>above the begin{document} command, where file list is a comma separated         list of files you want included. LaTeX will still read in all the cross-referencing         information for the missing chapters, but won't include them in the pdf         file. There is a definite advantage to this if you have a large number         of images in your results chapter, which you don't need when you're working         the introduction. You can still reference all the figures in the omitted         chapter, as long as you have previously LATEXed the document without the         \includeonly command.</p>      <p>An example file:</p>      <blockquote>         <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">\documentclass[letter]{report}<br>          \begin{document}<br>          \title{A Sample PhD Thesis}<br>          \author{A.

If you ready to see the final document,         save each individual file and run LaTeX on the main file, thesis.tex.</p>      <h2>Page Styles<a name="page"></a></h2>      <p>Your professor may want your header and footer to look different from         the standard of just the page number centered in the footer. The Thesis         template is already customized to have different headers and footers.         By using the<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> \pagestyle</font>         command, you can change the basic formatting of the page. Make sure to         place the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> \pagestyle</font> command         at the start of the document right before the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">\begin{document}</font>         command.</p>      <p>The pagestyle command will look like this:</p>      <blockquote>         <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">\pagestyle{<em>style</em>}</font></p>      </blockquote>      <p>You must have an argument for style. Your options are the following:</p>      <ul>        <li>plain - The page header is empty and the footer has the centered page           number. This is the default for the article class.</li>        <li>empty - The page header and footer are empty. This appropriate for           the first page of a paper according to the Chicago Manual of Style.</li>        <li>headings - The header contains the page number and title (of the section           or chapter} and the footer is empty. This is the default for the book           class.</li>        <li>myheadings - The same of headings except you can define the left and           right titles using the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">\markright           </font>or <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">\markboth</font> commands.</li>      </ul>      <p>You can also use the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">\thispagestyle</font>         command to change the style of the current page only.</p>      <h2>Verse<a name="verse"></a></h2>      <p>Poetry needs to be specially formatted, whether you are quoting more         than a line or creating an original composition. Despite its background         in math and the sciences, LaTeX does an outstanding job of formatting         poetry correctly, with support for stanzas and proper formatting of lines         longer than the width of the page.</p>      <p>Here is an example of the verse environment:</p>      <blockquote>         <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">\begin{verse}<br>          It is an ancient mariner, \\<br>          And he stoppeth one of three. \\<br>          `` By thy long grey beard and glittering eye, \\<br>          Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?<br>          <br>          ``The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,\\<br>          And I am next of kin;\\<br>          The guests are met, the feast is set:\\<br>          May'st hear the merry din."<br>          <br>          He holds him with his skinny hand,\\<br>          `` There was a ship," quoth he.\\<br>          `` Hold off! unhand me, greybeard loon!"\\<br>          Eftsoons his hand dropt he.<br>          \end{verse}</font></p>      </blockquote>      <p>This is how it looks once it is typeset by LaTeX:</p>      <p align="center"><img src="images/verse.jpg" width="222" height="186"></p>      <h2>Quotations<a name="quote"></a></h2>      <p>There are two different ways to format long quotations in LaTeX. Make         sure you use the correct one for your discipline. The standard format         is to indent the long quotation from both sides with no additional indent         for the first line of a paragraph using the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">quote</font>         environment. Most professors prefer long quotations to be single-spaced.</p>      <blockquote>         <blockquote>           <p>A new propaganda organization has been set up in Washington recently,             consisting of some thirty-five hundred American writers, headed by             Rex Stout, well-known detective story and pulp magazine writer.
