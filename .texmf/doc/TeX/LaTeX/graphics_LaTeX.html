  </font>
</ol>

<p>
<b><i>The answers to these questions are:</i></b>
<ol>
  <li>
  The most crude way to convert a Windows image into a .eps file for use in LaTeX
  is to use the <tt>gif2ps</tt> or <tt>jpeg2ps</tt> commands.  If the image is a gif 
  file, go to a UNIX prompt, and type:<br>
  <br>
  <tt>gif2ps myfile.gif > myfile.eps</tt><br>
  <br>
  Or, if it is a .jpg (or .jpeg) file, then go to a UNIX prompt and type:<br>
  <br>
  <tt>gif2ps myfile.gif > myfile.eps</tt><br>
  <p></li>

  <li>
  A less crude way to get images into LaTeX is by importing them into xfig, and then
  exporting them from xfig into .eps format.  This seems to generally make the final
  eps image take up less memory (by a considerable amount).  To do this, follow the 
  following steps: <p>
   <ul>
      <li>Open xfig.  You require some kind of UNIX front-end to do this.  People
	     in the engineering department could use xwin32 to do this.<p></li>
	  
      <li>Click on the button "Figure", and then click the mouse in two places, thus
	     creating the top-left and bottom-right corner positions of the (future) image.<p></li>
	  
      <li>In the menu that pops up, choose your file.  It can be any format out of
	     .gif, .jpeg, .jpg, .tiff, .eps, .ps, .pcx, .ppm, .xbm or .xpm.  (I haven't tried 
		 any others, like .bmp, but that might work - let me know if it does!)
		 You are free to resize the image to whatever size you choose.<p></li>
	  
      <li>Choose "File" -> "Export", and save it as a .eps (encaptulated
	     postscript) file.<p></li>
	  
	  <li>Then, in LaTeX, do the usual<br>
	     <tt>\begin{figure}<br>
		 \includegraphics{myfile.eps}<br> 
	     \end{graphics}</tt><p></li>
   </ul>
  <p></li>

  <li>
  If you want to add a label(s) to the .gif or .jpg file before turning it into
  a .eps file, then do the following:<p>
   <ul>
      <li>Go back into xfig, import the .gif/.jpg file as above<p></li>
	  
      <li>Before exporting, click on the text button to insert text; then add 
	     arrows and lines and whatever you like, in the normal xfig way.<p></li>
	  
      <li>Export the file as above, and include it in the LaTeX file (also as
	     above).<p></li>
   </ul>
  <p></li>

  <li>
  If you want to make sure that the labels on your figure don't change size, or
  even better you want to guarantee that they will be the same size as the text
  of your document, then you can use the <tt>\psfrag{}{}</tt> command alongside
  the <tt>\includegraphics{}</tt> command:<p>
   <ul>
      <li>Go back into xfig, import the image file (as above, if necessary).<p></li>
	  
      <li>Now, instead of putting the label that you want on the figure in xfig, just
	     put any non-spaced text, say "<tt>label_me</tt>" in the place where you will
		 want the label.<p></li>
	  
      <li>Then export the file as above, and include it in the LaTeX file (also as
	     above).<p></li>
	  
      <li>Now in LaTeX, you can specify some text for the label, in the figure 
	      environment.  You must:<p>
		  <ul>
		     <li>Add in <tt>\usepackage{psfrag}</tt> at the start of the document.<p></li>
			 
		     <li>Specify what you want the label to actually say in the figure
			    environment.  This is done by putting
				<tt>\psfrag{text-used-in-xfig-label}{text-you-want-in-label}</tt>
				inside the figure bit.  <b>Note this seems only to work with
				<tt>\includegraphics</tt>, and not <tt>\psfig</tt>!</b>
				For example:<br>
				<br>
				<tt>\begin{figure}<br>
				\psfrag{label_me}{I am a pretty label.}<br>
				\includegraphics{myfile.eps}<br>
				\end{figure}</tt><br>
				<br>
				would place the label "I am a pretty label." in the figure, at the 
				location where the text "label_me" was inserted in xfig.<p></li>
		  </ul>
	  <p></li>
	  
	  <li>Note that the graphics won't show up until you run <tt>dvips</tt> and view
	     the document in ghostview.<p></li>
   </ul>
  <p></li>
  
  <li>
  If you want to include an equation in an image in a figure, then just include an
  'in-line equation' in the text for the label.  This is just as above, except with
  "<tt>I am a pretty label.</tt>" replaced by, say, "<tt>Boltzmann states $S=k \ln \Omega$.</tt>".
  <p></li>

  <li>
  If you decide you want to insert a multiple-line bit of text into a Figure (for example
  you want to the word "kinematic" on one line and "boundary conditions" the next), then
  there is a way of doing this without doing a separate <tt>\psfrag</tt> command for each
  line.  [Note, if you use a separate <tt>\psfrag</tt> command for each line, then 
  the line spacing would get screwed up if you resized your figure - try it and you'll see!]
  The way to do it is to use <b>tabular</b> environment in the <tt>\psfrag</tt> command.
  So, for example, <br>
  <br>
  <tt>\begin{figure}<br>
  \psfrag{label_me}{\begin{tabular}{c} kinematic \\ boundary conditions \end{tabular}}<br>
  \includegraphics{myfile.eps}<br>
  \end{figure}</tt><br>
  <br>
  would insert<br>
  <br>
  <center><font face="Times, Times New Roman, helvetica, Arial" size="3">
  kinematic<br>
  boundary conditions<br>
  </center></font>
  <br>
  into the image, wherever the text "label_me" was placed when creating myfile.eps.
  <p></li>

I'm no expert in LaTeX, I have just been told that the above information could be
useful to a number of people!  Incidently, a postscript driver is available from Adobe: see

ADDITIONAL NOTE (19 March 2003):  I have noticed that xfig seems to reduce the resolution of 
jpeg files when importing them (with the method described above).  A method which I have found
for avoiding this tedious problem is to save the original jpeg file as a physically large 
(for example 12inches x 12inches) image, and then shrink it down to the required size
(using the "Scale" button) in xfig.  Hope this is useful to someone...

ADDITIONAL NOTE (7 May 2003):  Many people want to take a Word document and stick it straight
into LaTeX, having already drawn figures in Word.  Copying the text into LaTeX is easy; the 
challenge is to get the figures into LaTeX!  I have developed a strategy for doing this, 
WHICH DOESN'T REQUIRE EXPORTING THE GRAPHICS INTO JPEG, GIFF, TIFF, OR ANY OTHER GRAPHICS
FILE FORMAT.  It is (concisely put) as follows: <br>
1.  Make sure you have a "generic postscript printer driver", and a color one if necessary.
This is so that you can print the Word document to a postscript file.  Helpful instructions
on how to obtain a "generic postscript printer driver" can be found at 
<a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/USCS/DTS/printing/" target=_blank>this website</a>.<br>
2.  Isolate one drawing or figure at a time, and copy that drawing into a new Word document
all on its own.  Make sure that document is only a single page long.<br>
3.  Print that document to a file using the postscript printer driver, using the option
"Print to File".<br>
4.  Change the filename extension of the resulting file from ".prn" to ".eps".<br>
5.  Open the file in a text editor (such as notepad, winedt, meditor).  Notice that
there are several lines in the file containing the phrase "Bounding Box".  Find the last
such command in the file, and change its coordinates so that the Bounding Box is close to 
the edges of the drawing.  (Note, I have found that there are several Bounding Box commands 
in the file, but that modifying the last one is sufficient.)
<i>NOTE: You can view the bounding box in ghostview, which is available for free for
PC's as gsview.exe - see 
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html" target=_blank>this website</a>.</i><br>
6.  It may be necessary to use ghostscript to convert the "ps" file into a "eps" file 
(postscript into encaptulated postscript); ghostscript is available at 
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/" target=_blank>this website [click here]</a>.
This is necessary in some cases, but not all cases.<br>
7.  Insert the resulting eps file into your LaTeX document as normal, using \includegraphics{}.
