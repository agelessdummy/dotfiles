<H2> Intro - Why use BibTeX? </H2>

BibTeX is a package for creating bibliographies in LaTeX
documents. One needs only to maintain one database file with
bibliography information, which can then be read into any number of
documents, and the bibliography is automatically made when the file is
processed. Advantages over making manual bibliographies include:
consistency in presentation of entries, ease of changing bibliography
style, correct numbering and sequential ordering of entries, and the
only entries in the bibliography of the final document are those that
are cited in the body of the document.

<P>When compiling the document you need to LaTeX the file, then BibTeX
it, then LaTeX it twice. When you do this BibTeX finds all the papers
you have cited using the <I>\cite{...}</I> command in your LaTeX
document and makes an auxiliary file with the extension <B>.bbl</B>
which contains the bibliography information the papers cited in your
document, and numbers them all in order of appearance.

<P>Since you only need one file, you don't need to create a bibliography
for each new document - it happens automatically when you compile the
document!

<A NAME="60seconds"></A>
<H2> BibTeX in 60 seconds </H2>

Ok, so you just want to give it a whirl. No worries, just:

<OL>
<LI> Download a bibliography style file such as 
<A HREF="h-physrev3.bst"><I>h-physrev3.bst</I>,</A>&nbsp; into the
directory where your document is.  (There are many options about -
just look around the web.)
<LI> Create your bibliography database file by downloading (into the
directory where your document is) and editing the example
file  <A HREF="tau.bib"><I>tau.bib</I></A>.
<LI> Remove any &nbsp;<TT>\begin{thebibliography}</TT>&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;<TT>\end{thebibliography}</TT>&nbsp; commands from your
document.
<LI> Just before the &nbsp;<TT>\end{document}</TT>&nbsp; command, add
<P>
<PRE>
\bibliographystyle{h-physrev3.bst}
\bibliography{tau}
</PRE>
<P> (Alternatively, just download and edit this <A
HREF="example.tex">
example</A>&nbsp; file.)

<LI> When processing the file, you need to do:
<B>latex</B><I> filename</I>,
<B>bibtex</B><I> filename</I>,
<B>latex</B><I> filename</I>,
<B>latex</B><I> filename</I>.
</OL>

<A NAME="howto"></A>
<H2> How to use BibTeX - the slightly more-detailed version </H2>

To run BibTeX you need two extra files, one a bibliography
<I>style</I> file (which has the extension <B>.bst</B>)
which tells BibTeX how to display your bibliography, and a
<I>database</I> (which has extension <B>.bib</B>)
with your bibliography information.

<P> When you run BibTeX (using the <I>latex-bibtex</I> commands
in the sequence described above), an auxilliary file is created called
<I>filename.bbl</I>, which stores the bibliography information specific
to your document. If you change the document, e.g., by adding more
citations, when you run <I>latex-bibtex</I> again, this file will be
updated.

<P>Examples of style files and a starter bibliography database file:

<DL>
<DT> Style File:
<DD> There are several styles in common use, my favourites
being&nbsp;
<A HREF="prsty.bst"><I>prsty.bst</I>,</A>&nbsp;
<A HREF="h-elsevier2.bst"><I>h-elsevier2.bst</I>,</A>&nbsp;
<A HREF="h-physrev3.bst"><I>h-physrev3.bst</I></A>&nbsp;

<P>The latter two show also eprint numbers, which can be rather useful if
some of your papers appear only in pre-print form. However, it's a
rather easy job to edit this bit into the <I>.bbl</I> file produced
from <I>prsty.bst</I>. The best thing to do is to try out the style
files and choose the one that looks best, or that gives the format of
the journal you're writing for.

<P>
<DT> Bibliography Database:
<DD> This is the users own file that contains all the information for
bibliography entries on a range of papers, books, etc., that you might
want to cite. The file must have the extension <I>.bib</I>. The
syntax for a range of entries is shown in the example file <A
HREF="tau.bib"><I>tau.bib</I></A>&nbsp;
</DL>

Instead of the manual bibliography information with
&nbsp;<TT>\begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}</I>&nbsp;
information, you just enter (just before the
&nbsp;<TT>\end{document}</TT>&nbsp; command):  

<P>
<PRE>
\bibliographystyle{h-physrev3}
\bibliography{physics}
</PRE>

<P> This tells BibTeX which style to use for displaying the
bibliography (in this example, it uses the <I>h-elsevier2</I> style,
where the full filename is <I>h-elsevier2.bst</I>),
and the name of the bibliography database file (which will have the
full filename <I>physics.bib</I>).

<p>
Actually, you can use multiple bibliographies in a LaTeX document by
just having a series of <code><b>\bibliography{...}</b></code>
commands. This allows you to use, for example, a set of bibliography
items used and maintained by a group of people, and additionally a set
of your own private bibliography entries, with

<p>
<pre>
\bibliographystyle{h-physrev3}
\bibliography{groupbibentries}
\bibliography{mybibentries}
</pre>


<A NAME="nicethings"></A>
<H2> Some nice things about BibTeX </H2>

<A NAME="format"></A>
<H4> Entries in an appropriate format already exist
</H4>

The nice people at SLAC have a BibTeX format in their search options
for hep articles in the <A HREF="
http://www-spires.slac.stanford.edu/find/hep">Spires
Database</A>&nbsp; and choosing the BibTeX format in the format
options just below where you enter the search command. This means that
for the vast majority of papers you don't even have to enter the
bibliography information by hand!

<A NAME="emacs"></A>
<H4> <TT>Emacs</TT> has a BibTeX mode </H4>

When you load up a <I>.bib</I> database file, <TT>Emacs</TT>
recognises it as a BibTeX file and enters the BibTeX format, which
includes a menu bar with drop-down menus for features like
preformatted entry templates (just in case the entry you want to
create isn't available on the Spires database), and other utilities
for checking the syntax of bibliography entries. (AFAIK, this feature
isn't available on MS-Word). 

<A NAME="entrytypes"></A>
<H4> Types of entries </H4>

There are many types of entries that one might want to include in a
bibligraphy, and it can be hard to get them standardized with the rest
of the world, for example: Articles in Journals, Contributions to
Conference Proceedings, Theses (published and otherwise), etc. Using
either templates available from the BibTeX mode of Emacs, or from
looking at similar entries on Spires, you can find a suitable and
consistent layout for all such entries.

<A NAME="styles"></A>
<H4> How about changing styles? </H4 >

Just change the BibTeX style file. Other types of style file can be
found in places like CTAN sites, for example: <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.uni-augsburg.de/pub/tex/ctan/"> CTAN-Germany</A>

<A NAME="submission"></A>
<H4> When you want to submit articles? </H4>

When submitting articles, one really wants the bibliography in the
body of the document. This is easily done:

<UL>
<LI> First remove the <TT>\bibliography{...}</TT> and
<TT>\bibliographystyle{...}</TT> commands from the document,
<LI> Then insert the auxilliary file, that BibTeX created when you
processed the document, called <I>filename.bbl</I> just before the
<TT>\end{document}</TT> command
</UL>

<P> Now you have what looks (and acts) like a document with a manual
(and hence editable if you want to do some fine-tuning) bibliography.

<A NAME="example"></A>
<H2> For example.</H2>

The document <A
HREF="example.tex">
<I>example.tex</I></A>&nbsp; a very basic LaTeX document with the
commands to make a BibTeX bibliography. Note that the bibliography it
produces has only 2 entries, although the following bibliography
database has 3 entries. This is because only 2 of these are cited in
<I>example.tex</I>.

<P> To process this file, the style file <A
HREF="h-physrev3.bst"><I>h-physrev3.bst</I>,</A>&nbsp; is needed, as
well as the BibTeX database file <A
HREF="tau.bib"><I>physics.bib</I></A>. On processing (remember:
<I> latex, bibtex, latex, latex</I>), the auxilliary file
<I>example.bbl</I> is created which has the bibliography information
for <I>example.tex</I> in it.
