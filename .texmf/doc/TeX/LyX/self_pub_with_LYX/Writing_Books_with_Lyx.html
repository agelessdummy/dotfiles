<h1>
<a name="introduction"></a>Introduction to Lyx</h1>
This article introduces Lyx from a 10,000 foot overview.
<h2>
What Is Lyx?</h2>
Lyx is a document processor. It handles all document formatting based on
styles and a set of rules to translate those styles to formatting. Therefore
your book is consistent throughout. And if you use the same set of rules
on multiple books, they'll all be formatted consistently.
<p>Lyx uses paragraph styles (which are called "<i>environments</i>" in
Lyx parlance) to govern formatting of document pieces. There are styles
for different level headers, for emphasis, for peoples' names, for code
snippets. And you can make your own styles, although that isn't simple.
</p><p>If you use LyX, your documents will output as beautifully typeset documents
with consistently professional formatting. They'll look like a book you
see in the bookstore. And because LyX handles the formatting, you can spend
your time and energy on what you're writing, not how it will look.
</p><p>As mentioned, the LyX default styles may not format exactly how you
want. In such cases you can modify styles or even make your own. This web
page contains <a href="#textclass_mod_tut">tutorials</a> that walk you
through creating your own style.
</p><h2>
What Lyx Isn't</h2>
Lyx isn't a word processing program. You can't (and shouldn't) format individual
words or paragraphs. Instead you assign styles to the words or paragraphs.
Those styles correspond to the words and paragraphs' function, not to the
way you want them to look. You'd never use Lyx to design a high impact
flyer, or a poster, or a love letter. Lyx configuration is difficult enough
that you don't start seeing a return on your configuration investment unless
you write books or *lots* of reports.
<h2>
WYGIWYM</h2>
We've all heard of WYSIWYG. Lyx is WYGIWYM. WYGIWYM stands for "What You
Get Is What You Mean". This means if you mean for text to represent source
code you assign it a source code <i>environment</i> (Lyxese for style),
and it formats the way you meant it to. You needn't worry about formatting
during the writing of your document. If you don't like the way it looks
upon finishing and printing it out, you can change the way styles map to
formatting, and those styles will consistently change throughout the document.
<p>WYGIWYM has spacing ramifications. Spaces are considered nothing but
word separators, and as such multiple spaces are output as a single space.
Likewise, carriage returns (newlines and the like) are simply paragraph
separators, and as such you cannot make a blank line by inserting an additional
return. Blank lines should never be necessary. Instead, each paragraph
specifies interparagraph spacing, spacing before the first of such paragraphs,
and spacing after the last of such paragraphs.
</p><p>This is a matter of philosophy. Do we view a book as 300 pages, each
of which is a sketch or painting? Or do we view it as parts containing
chapters containing various levels of headings containing paragraphs of
varying types, such as normal body text, code examples, notes, tips, warnings
and the like. LyX takes the latter view, and thus simply declares the formatting
of various paragraph styles. Such formatting can be complex, including
lines, graphics, justification, spacing, and almost anything else you can
think of. The beauty of this philosophy is once you've decided the properties
of each paragraph style, those decisions are applied uniformly throughout
your book. If you decide to change one of those styles, every paragraph
of that style is instantly updated throughout your book.
</p><p>A cynic might label this as WYGIWWA - "What You Get Is What We Allow".
Lyx makes the rules and unless you're knowledgeable enough to change those
rules you just accept what Lyx says you get. This is one of the reasons
for the paragraph and character style examples on this page -- to let you
use Lyx without settling for an unsatisfactory format.
</p><h2>
Data Safety</h2>
In this era of software rental licenses and companies going out of business,
it's nice to know that your documents are in easy to parse ascii text.
It's quite easy to write a simple computer program to convert Lyx documents
to other formats. The native Lyx format is even human readable, so there's
every reason to believe that 20 years from now you'll be able to get your
hands on your data.
<p>Data safety was the #1 reason I chose LyX. The books I write are vital
to my business.

</p><h1>
<a name="BuiltinParagraphStyles"></a>Built in Paragraph Styles</h1>
This section details the available paragraph styles contained in the "book"
document class. There are other document classes such as "article", "letter",
"seminar", "slides", "broadway" (scripts for plays), "hollywood" (movie
scripts), and many more, including some specialized styles for different
types of books. However, this web page discusses the "book" document class,
because it provides the nicest looking general purpose styles for books.
This document then goes on to instruct you how to change existing styles
and make new styles to get exactly the book you want.
<h2>

This is a list of the heading styles, in order of inclusiveness (i.e. a

<a name="BuiltinCharacterStyles"></a>Built in Character Styles</h1>
There are no built in character styles as a book author would think of
them. This is a serious deficiency which the LyX people plan to correct
in the future. So this deficiency won't hurt your long term use of LyX.
<p>Frustratingly, fonts like font-code are sometimes referred to as styles
in the LyX world. In fact, using font-code introduces a \family typewriter
into the LyX file, so it's no different from using &lt;tt&gt; in your HTML
to represent code. There's not a one to one correspondence.
</p><p>Nevertheless, it's easiest to use font-code to represent a small slice
of code within a larger paragraph. Here are some of the other fonts I use
to represent things:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<table nosave="" border="1" cols="3" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td></td>

<td></td>

<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>font-emph</td>

<td>C-e</td>

<td>Emphasized text (italicized)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>font-code</td>

<td>Create in ~/.lyx/ui/default.ui.</td>

<td>Filenames, tiny commands and other code like things within a larger
paragraph (fixed spaced text)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>font-noun</td>

<td>M-c c</td>

<td>Terminology -- words to be defined, etc. (small caps)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><p>Styles are supposed to map to usages, and it's obvious that the preceding
fonts do not. So they're a compromise. But it works as long as you don't
use italics, smallcaps or monofonts for other things. If you do not, then
when LyX gains character style capabilities it will be trivial to search/replace
these fonts with real styles.
</p><p>But of course you will use italicized, fixed space and small cap text
for other things. That's OK as long as those other usages are done with
color pseudostyles.
</p><h1>
<a name="SimulatingCharacterStylesWithColorPseudostyles"></a>Simulating
Character Styles With Color Pseudostyles</h1>
This section will show you how to set up a one to one correspondence between
character color and a LaTeX character style. This allows you to easily
convert to real character styles when LyX gains that feature. Place the
following code near the top of your .layout file.
<br>&nbsp;
<table nosave="" bgcolor="#ccffff" border="1">
<tbody><tr nosave="">
<td nosave="">
<pre>Preamble
% %%% Pseudo character styles indexed by color %%%
\usepackage{ifthen}
\renewcommand{\textcolor}[2]{%
\ifthenelse{\equal{#1}{blue}}{{\textsl{\textsf{#2}}}}{}%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steps
\ifthenelse{\equal{#1}{magenta}}{{\textsl{\textsf{#2}}}}{}%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapters
\ifthenelse{\equal{#1}{magenta}\or\equal{#1}{blue}}{}{#2}%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fallthrough
}
EndPreamble</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The <tt>Preamble</tt> and <tt>EndPreamble</tt> keywords are LyX code.
Everything between them is LaTeX code. In fact, it's safe to assume that
any code between&nbsp; <tt>Preamble</tt> and <tt>EndPreamble</tt> is LaTeX
code.
</p><p>The <tt>ifthen</tt> package bestows the ability to assign according
to choices -- in this case colors. the \usepackage keyword incorporates
that package much the same as a Perl <tt>use</tt> or a&nbsp; C <tt>include</tt>.
</p><h1>
<a name="ParagraphStylesLyXEnvironments"></a>Paragraph Styles (LyX Environments)</h1>
Books need styles like Tip, Note, Warning and the like. The following code
implements a Note style, narrower than normal text, contained between lines,

<p>In the preceding, the style is described first in LyX code (everything
except that between <tt>Preamble</tt> and <tt>EndPreamble</tt>), and a
parallel description in LaTeX (everything between <tt>Preamble</tt> and
<tt>EndPreamble</tt>).
You'll note that I didn't bother to put the lines in the LyX version.
</p><p>Note also there are plenty other ways to do this. The best way is probably
to enclose the note in a minipage, but I don't know how to do that yet.
</p><h1>
<a name="lyx4me"></a>Will Lyx Suit My Needs?</h1>
Why use LyX?
<p>Because once you learn it, you can easily and quickly produce books,
reports and other large documents that are professionally formatted and
typeset. These documents can be put into Postscript or PDF format so they
print correctly everywhere.
</p><p>I chose LyX after getting tired of inconsistent typefaces. After getting
tired of having to remember whether I made a style for things. After getting
tired of trying to remember what font I made a given entity the last time.
</p><p>I got tired of manually tweaking books to get the paging right. I got
tired of inaccurate tables of contents. I got tired of printing inconsistencies.
</p><p>I got tired of my word processor slowing me down. That same word processor
that seemed so easy to learn ages ago, but now confounded me with an array
of formatting choices seemingly every paragraph.
</p><p>Now I can reasonably expect to write a professional looking book, and
send a postscript file to the print shop of my choice.
</p><p>But LyX requires a serious committment. A person who could learn MS
Word or Star Office in a day could take a week or more to learn Lyx unless
they approach that learning process the right way. The creation and modification
of environments (styles) in LyX are inobvious to say the least. You will
not successfully write books with Lyx unless you make a serious committment
to learn the program and style modification. This page contains an article
called <a href="#fastestLearn">The Fast Way to Learn Lyx</a>, designed
to make your committment much more achievable.
</p><p>LyX suits your needs if you need its benefits and can handle its costs.
The benefit is uniformly consistent formatting of your books, reports and
other large documents, without your needing to oversee that consistency.
The cost is learning LyX (easy) and learning to create and modify its styles
(difficult, but made much easier by the <a href="#textclass_mod_tut">tutorials
on this page</a>).
</p><h1>
<a name="evaluating"></a>Evaluating Lyx for Your Needs</h1>
First, know that you can use LyX to produce almost any type of printed
document you can imagine. It's that flexible. It's VERY doubtful that LyX
would not be able to produce what you need, unless what you need is formatted
on the fly stuff like flyers, posters, invitations and the like. But for
serious documents like books, reports, and even business letters, you can
be 99% certain that LyX can be made to produce the format you need. LyX
is ALMOST NEVER a dead end. As a matter of fact, it's much less likely
to be a dead end than more mainstream word processors.
<p>But that doesn't mean it will be easy. Changing default environment
to format mappings is much more difficult with LyX than with standard word
processors. See the article titled <a href="#fastestLearn">The Fast Way
to Learn Lyx</a> to minimize the LyX training period.
</p><p>Here are some of the questions you'll need to answer in order to decide
for or against Lyx:
</p><ul>
<li>
How important is consistency in my documents (Lyx is very consistent)</li>

<li>
Can I live with Lyx's default document classes and formatting? (If so,
go
with LyX -- it's a no brainer)</li>

<li>
Do I or somebody in my organization have the ability to learn to I create
and modify Lyx styles to produce output suiting my needs? (Before answering,
read the rest of this web page. After reading the web page, if the answer
is No, LyX doesn't suit your needs).</li>

<li>
Is the Lyx program's performance sufficient for books the size I want to
write, and if my books are big enough to slow it down, am I willing to
write the books in parts and put everything together in the end (makes
crossreferencing harder)</li>

<ul>
<li>
Note: My dual 450mhz Celeron with 512Meg and a 7200rpm hard drive can load,
reformat, or output to Postscript in less than 20 seconds for a 100,000
word (about 250-300page) document. On the same document I can save in less
than 5 seconds. However, on a 550,000 word doc (about 1200-1400 pages)
it takes about 3 minutes to load or reformat.</li>
</ul>

<li>
How important is a good index to me? (LyX is great at indexing)</li>

<li>
How important is a good, accurate table of contents to me? (LyX produces
good looking and accurate tables of contents)</li>

<li>
How important is guaranteed future access to my book's data (proprietary
wordprocessors are often hard to export from).</li>

<li>
Are you proficient with a capable text editor with macros and search/replace?
(Proper use of a text editor on your LyX files can greatly enhance your
LyX capabilities, although this isn't absolutely necessary for profitable
use of LyX).</li>
</ul>
I'd recommend starting by using Lyx for reports (they have a Report document
class). If that works out use their Letter document class to produce letters
whose format isn't important (personal letters and the like).
<p>Take the tutorial later in this web page. If you're successful with
it you'll probably be able to commit to Lyx. If you cannot do the tutorial
after many repeated attempts, Lyx is probably not for you. That is, unless
you have a consultant who can modify document classes and environments.
Many businesses have computer experts create macros and templates so that
less technical people can produce corporate standard documents.
</p><p>Run performance tests to see how Lyx works on your computer with books
resembling the size and structure of yours. This page contains a C program
you can use to create just such a test book. If you can't compile the program,
have a programmer friend do it. If the performance is insufficient, you'll
need to

<a name="fastestLearn"></a>The Fast Way to Learn Lyx</h1>
LyX can take a day or two to learn, or it could take weeks, depending on
how you approach learning it. This article describes how to learn LyX in
a day or two.
<p>LyX has two distinct aspects:
</p><ol>
<li>
Creating content</li>

<li>
Controlling the format of that content in the output</li>
</ol>
#1 is no harder than any other word processor, and it's probably actually
easier than most word processors. The best way to learn #1 is to run the
LyX tutorial (Help-&gt;Tutorial from the menu). Once finished with the LyX
tutorial, you'll have an excellent grasp of how to write content in LyX.
That leaves #2:
<p>#2 is much harder than with other word processors. First, most word
processors allow you to format content on the fly. LyX doesn't allow that
because on-the-fly formatting leads to inconsistant and amatuerish documents.
If you want professional looking documents, LyX is your product.
</p><p>But changing the mapping of styles to formatting is much harder than
in programs like WordPerfect, MS Word or StarOffice. It requres knowledge
of LyX coding and the LaTeX markup language. Both are extensively documented,
but unfortunately the documentation is a reference, not a tutorial.
</p><p>So I created some tutorials to walk you through creating and formatting
your first LyX style (LyX styles are actually called "environments"). Those
tutorials appear <a href="#textclass_mod_tut">on this page</a>. These tutorials
will take you one to four hours, after which you'll be ready to create
custom environments to make your document look the way you want it to,
consistently.
</p><p>In summary, if you'd like to trim the LyX learning process down to a
day or two, do the LyX tutorial, and then do the <a href="#textclass_mod_tut">tutorial
on this page</a>.
</p><p>To shorten the learning time, use tutorials. Start with the tutorial
that comes with LyX (Help-&gt;Tutorial).
</p><h1>
<a name="textclass_mod_tut"></a>Beginning Textclass Modification Tutorial</h1>
Lyx is a wonderful program with wonderful documentation. The docs tell
you every aspect of Lyx user operation, as well as giving you all sorts
of Lyx functions and Latex codes (the latter being in /usr/share/texmf...).
But there's a gaping hole in the docs when it comes to exactly how you
create new environments in a real life situation. All too often the documentation
tells you what to insert but assumes you know where to insert it. All too
often you get your new environment into Lyx, only to find that it doesn't
render in Postscript or DVI.
<p>This tutorial and the next one are designed to condense a week of manual
reading, emailing and experimentation into two 1 hour tutorials. This is
the first tutorial, designed to give you the fundimentals. Read on...
</p><h2>
Proof of Concept</h2>
This proof of concept does nothing but enable a new textclass to appear
in your Layout-&gt;Document-&gt;Document-&gt;Class dropdown list. It has no practical
use, and must be reversed out, meaning that you must make a backup of the
file you modify.
<ol>
<li>
Log in as root</li>

<li>
Find your system's Lyx layout directory.&nbsp; It's typically in /usr/share/lyx/layouts,
but of course can vary. The following two commands may help you find it:</li>

<br><tt>locate -r "article\.layout$"</tt>
<br><tt>find / -type f | grep "article\.layout$"</tt>
<br>Note however that your system contains other copies of article.layout.
The one you want should have "lyx" in the directory path.
<li>
<tt>cd</tt> to the Lyx layout directory. From there, the <tt>pwd</tt> command
should reveal "lyx" somewhere in the directory name, and there should exist
several <tt>.layout</tt> files.</li>

<li>
Back up the <tt>article.layout</tt> file with the following command:</li>

<br><tt>cp -p article.layout article.layout.org</tt>
<li>
Edit article.layout. Change the second line, which looks like this:</li>

<br><tt>#&nbsp; \DeclareLaTeXClass{article}</tt>
<br>to this:
<br><tt>#&nbsp; \DeclareLaTeXClass{Hello World}</tt>
<li>
Reconfigure Lyx with Edit-&gt;Reconfigure</li>

<li>
Close all copies of Lyx, open a Lyx session, open a file, and note that
the Layout-&gt;Document-&gt;Document-&gt;Class dropdown list now contains a class
called "Hello World".</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Discussion</h3>
You have just changed the name of the "Article" class to "Hello World".
For reasons you'll see later, this is useless except as a confidence building
exercise.
<h2>
Changing an Environment's Font in the Proof of Concept</h2>
In this exercise you will change the font and alignment of the Author environment
(an environment is Lyx's word for a paragraph style), to see what it affects,
and perhaps more importantly, what it does not effect.
<ol>
<li>
Create a baseline article</li>

<ol>
<li>
Use Lyx to create a new two line document of type "Hello World". The first
line should be "Title" and should be formatted to the <i>Title</i> environment
(chosen from the Layout-&gt;Document-&gt;Document-&gt;Class dropdown list).&nbsp;
The second line should be "Author" and should be formatted to the <i>Author</i>
environment picked from the same dropdown.</li>

<li>
Save as <tt>z.lyx</tt>.</li>

<li>
Notice that in Lyx both the words "Title" and "Author" are centered, and
that the word "Title" is much bigger than the word "Author".</li>

<li>
Use View-&gt;Postscript to view the document in a viewer. Notice that the
words "Title" and "Author" are centered but skewed toward the right (they're
right of center), and that the word "Title" is much bigger than the word
"Author". Notice that there's a third line containing a date, but ignore
that line, as it's not relevant to the point being made. The main point
is that "Title" is bigger than "Author", and that they're both centered
toward the right.</li>

<li>
Exit the Lyx program.</li>
</ol>

<li>
Edit <tt>article.layout</tt></li>

<ol>
<li>
Add the following lines to the bottom of <tt>article.layout</tt>:</li>

<br><tt>Style Author</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Align&nbsp;&nbsp; Left</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; AlignPossible&nbsp; Left</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; Font</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Size&nbsp; Giant</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; EndFont</tt>
</p><li>
Understand that what you just did is modify the existing Article environment,
changing the alignment to left and the font size to <i>Giant</i>.</li>

<li>
Save <tt>article.layout</tt>.</li>
</ol>

<li>
Tell Lyx about the layout change.</li>

<ol>
<li>
In Lyx, Edit-&gt;Reconfigure</li>

<li>
Exit Lyx and run it again.</li>
</ol>

<li>
Notice the changes, and also notice what doesn't change</li>

<ol>
<li>
Pull up <tt>z.lyx</tt> in Lyx.</li>

<li>
Notice that now the word "Author" is larger than the word "Title", and
that the word "Author" is now left justified instead of centered.</li>

<li>
Use View-&gt;Postscript to view the document in a viewer. Notice that the
Postscript article is identical to the one formatted before the change.
"Author" is NOT bigger than "Title", nor is it left justified.</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<h3>
Discussion</h3>
File <tt>article.layout</tt> changes the layout of the article under Lyx,
but not the finished product. You must modify other files to change the
output.
<h2>
Exploring the Role of Layout Filenames</h2>
This exercise introduces the fact that filenames matter, and methods of
specifying the mapping between files and layouts initially appears almost
magical.
<ol>
<li>
Verify once more that environment "Hello World" appears in the Layout-&gt;Document-&gt;Document-&gt;Class
dropdown list.</li>

<li>
Rename <tt>article.layout</tt> to <tt>aarticle.layout.</tt></li>

<li>
In Lyx, Edit-&gt;Reconfigure</li>

<li>
Exit Lyx and run it again.</li>

<li>
Pull up <tt>z.lyx</tt> in Lyx</li>

<li>
Notice an error message saying "unknown textclass article".</li>

<li>
Notice that environment "Hello World" is now missing in the Layout-&gt;Document-&gt;Document-&gt;Class
dropdown list.</li>

<li>
Verify the following:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Changing <tt>\textclass article</tt>&nbsp; to <tt>\textclass aarticle</tt>
does not restore environment "Hello World".</li>

<li>
<tt>grep -r "article\.layout$" /usr/share/lyx</tt> reveals no config files
mapping to filename article.layout.</li>

<li>
Likewise, <tt>grep -r "article\.layout$" ~/.lyx</tt> reveals no config
files mapping to filename article.layout.</li>

<li>
Removing the "\.layout" from the preceding commands also reveals no information
on why filename <tt>article.layout</tt> is so special.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<h3>
Discussion</h3>
Obviously, something declares the filename <tt>article.layout</tt> to be
special, but at this point it's difficult to find. How do you get Lyx to
recognize a layout file of arbitrary filename? Read on...
<h2>
Recognizing a Layout with Arbitrary Filename</h2>
This exercise gets Lyx to recognize <tt>aarticle.layout</tt>, and postulates
the reason such a procedure was necessary.
<ol>
<li>
Edit <tt>aarticle.layout</tt>.</li>

<li>
Replace the current #&nbsp; \DeclareLaTeXClass line (should be the second
line) with the following:</li>

<br><tt>#&nbsp; \DeclareLaTeXClass[article]{Hello World}</tt>
<li>
Save aarticle.layout.</li>

<li>
In Lyx, Edit-&gt;Reconfigure</li>

<li>
Exit Lyx and run it again.</li>

<li>
Pull up <tt>z.lyx</tt> in Lyx</li>

<li>
Notice that the error message has disappeared.</li>

<li>
Notice that environment "Hello World" has returned to the Layout-&gt;Document-&gt;Document-&gt;Class
dropdown list.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Discussion</h3>
You just proved that Lyx DOES INDEED read every <tt>.layout</tt> file in
the lyx/layout directory, and that there's nothing magical about the filename.
This exercise makes that obvious because you renamed the file to an arbitrary
filename (<tt>aarticle.layout</tt> is definitely arbitrary -- a filename
that's mentioned nowhere except this tutorial.
<p>The key distinction is that the <tt>.layout</tt> file must name an existing
document class in order to be included in the Layout-&gt;Document-&gt;Document-&gt;Class
dropdown list. So once we referenced existing document class article (inside
the brackets), we get what we want. Almost.
</p><p>There are still 2 problems:
</p><ul>
<li>
We must have root access and are making the new layout system wide instead
of per user.</li>

<li>
We are still not modifying the finished product (Postscript or dvi or whatever)
to our desire.</li>
</ul>
The next exercise fixes the first problem...
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table nosave="" bgcolor="#ffcccc" border="1" width="80%">
<tbody><tr nosave="">
<td nosave=""><b><font size="+2">Now copy <tt>article.layout.org</tt> back to
<tt>article.layout</tt>
with the following command:</font></b>
<br><b><tt><font size="+2">cp -p article.layout.org article.layout</font></tt></b>
<br><b><font size="+2">Also, delete <tt>aarticle.layout</tt>.</font></b></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table></center>

<h2>
Modifying a Layout File the Right Way</h2>
The preceding exercises were done because they are easy to describe and
perform. However, they were useless because they cannibalized the Article
layout instead of using it as the basis of a more specialized layout. Also,
this method does not require being logged in as root.
<p>A couple facts for those of you trying to transpose this to a Windows-based
system:
<br><tt>~/.lyx</tt> means the <tt>.lyx</tt> directory (yes, it starts with
a dot) off your home directory. The tilde is UNIX shorthand for "home".
</p><ol>
<li>
Set the system back to original state</li>

<ol>
<li>
If you haven't yet, restore the original <tt>article.layout</tt> as described
preceding this exercise.</li>

<li>
rm <tt>aarticle.layout</tt></li>

<li>
In Lyx, Edit-&gt;Reconfigure</li>

<li>
Exit Lyx and run it again.</li>

<li>
Pull up <tt>z.lyx</tt> in Lyx</li>

<li>
Notice that there are no error messages</li>

<li>
Notice that the "Author" line is centered and smaller than the "Title"
line.</li>

<li>
Notice that environment "Hello World" is gone, but has been replaced by
environment "Article" in the Layout-&gt;Document-&gt;Document-&gt;Class dropdown
list.</li>

<li>
Understand that you have restored the system back to its original state.</li>
</ol>

<li>
Make a user-specific layout file</li>

<ol>
<li>
Log out and log back in as your normal username. For safety and security,
real work should not be done as a priveleged user.</li>

<li>
<tt>cp /usr/share/lyx/layouts/article.layout ~/.lyx/layouts/aarticle.layout</tt></li>

<li>
Edit file ~/.lyx/layouts/aarticle.layout</li>

<li>
Replace the current #&nbsp; \DeclareLaTeXClass line (should be the second
line) with the following:</li>

<br><tt>#&nbsp; \DeclareLaTeXClass[article]{Hello World}</tt>
<li>
Add the following lines to the bottom of <tt>aarticle.layout</tt>:</li>

<br><tt>Style Author</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Align&nbsp;&nbsp; Left</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; AlignPossible&nbsp; Left</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp; Font</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Size&nbsp; Giant</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; EndFont</tt>
</p><li>
Understand that what you just did is modify the existing Article environment,
changing the alignment to left and the font size to <i>Giant</i>.</li>

<li>
Save the file.</li>

<li>
In Lyx, Edit-&gt;Reconfigure</li>

<li>
Exit Lyx and run it again.</li>

<li>
Pull up <tt>z.lyx</tt> in Lyx</li>

<li>
Notice that the Layout-&gt;Document-&gt;Document-&gt;Class dropdown list contains
both document classes <i>article</i> and <i>Hello World</i>. Note that
toggling between the two document classes toggles the size and alignment
of the "Author line.</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<h3>
Discussion</h3>
You have extended the concept of configuring an arbitrarily named file
to link to an existing document class (Article in this case) to work with
your own personal Lyx directory. Without disturbing the existing Article
document class or layout, you've created your own document class, called
<i>Hello
World</i>, that implements a changed <i>Author</i> environment. Unfortunately,
the modifications to the <i>Author</i> environment do not show up in the
finished product (a Postscript, DVI or PDF file). Making the changes show
up in the finished product requires some additional exercises.
<h2>
Directly Inserting Code into the Document's Preamble</h2>
This exercise gives you a trivially simple example of changing the finished
document's appearance using the Document Preamble.
<ol>
<li>
View the original</li>

<ol>
<li>
View-&gt;Postscript</li>

<li>
Notice the layout</li>
</ol>

<li>
Change and view again</li>

<li>
Layout-&gt;Latex Preamble...</li>

<ol>
<li>
In the input box that appears, type these two commands:</li>

<br><tt>\setlength{\hoffset}{2 in}</tt>
<br><tt>\setlength{\voffset}{2 in}</tt>
<li>
Click the OK button.</li>

<li>
Save the file (File-&gt;Save)</li>

<li>
View-&gt;Postscript</li>

<li>
Notice that the output is now approximately 2 inches down and to the right.</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<h3>
Discussion</h3>
This exercise illustrates the simplist possible way to insert code in the
document preamble in order to change the output. If you remember up until
this time everything we did changed the layout in Lyx, but not the final
Postscript output. In subsequent exercises you will expand on placing code
in the preamble in order to get the final output you want.
<br>&nbsp;
<h1>

</p><p>Hit Enter, note that you're still in Whopper environment, and type some

</p><p>Save the file, then View-&gt;Postscript, and note that the lines formatted

</p><h2>
Discussion</h2>
This is the Real McCoy. The extra large font is seen in both Lyx and in
the output (Postscript). This is because the Lyx style, which starts with
keyword Style, points to the LaTeX code in the Preamble/EndPreamble section,
by virtue of the fact that the style's Latexname value is the same as the
LaTeX code's name.
<h3>
Explanation of Strategic Lines</h3>

<h4>
#&nbsp; \DeclareLaTeXClass[article]{article (Whopper Enabled)}</h4>
This declaration on the second line declares a new class called "article
(Whopper Enabled)" to be a class inheriting properties from already defined
class "article". The parentheses in the name are just text -- they have
no specific syntax function. This is the second line of the .layout file.
You'll notice every .layout file has something similar as its second line.
<h4>
Input stdclass.inc</h4>
This includes an include file called stdclass.inc, which contains definitions
required by any document class. It must appear near the top.
<h4>
Preamble</h4>
This line declares that everything between it and the EndPreamble line
go in the document's preamble. The preamble is the text above the authored
material.
<h4>
\newenvironment{whopr}{\begin {Huge}}{\end{Huge}\linebreak}</h4>
This is a LaTeX statement, not a Lyx function or keyword. This statement
is passed right through to Latex2e, the LaTeX interpreter.
<p>This command creates a new LaTeX (not LyX) environment. It therefore
is reflected in the appearance of the Postscript or DVI output, not in
the Lyx program.
</p><p>The general form for this type of command is:
</p><pre>\newenvironment{name}[num]{before}{after}</pre>
<tt>{name}</tt> is the name of the environment. <tt>[num]</tt> is optional
(all LaTeX encased in square brackets is optional). {begin} contains all
text and commands to be executed before printing the content typed into
the environment. {after} contains all text and commands to be executed
after the content typed into the environment. In this case before the content
the font is changed to Huge. After the content the Huge font is removed,
reverting text back to its original condition. And then a linebreak is
inserted, because we want the Whopper environment to resemble a heading
style.
<h4>
Style Whopper</h4>
This declares a LyX style governing the appearance in LyX. All the text
between this statement and its corresponding End statement (the last line
of the file in this case) pertain to this style.
<h4>
LatexType&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Environment</h4>
The Environment value of LatexType tells Lyx that the style has blocks
of commands and text at both the beginning and the end. Other valid values
are <tt>Paragraph, Command, Environment, Item_Environment, and List_Environment</tt>.
List and Item Environments are similar to <tt>Environment</tt>, except
they're part of enumerations. <tt>Command</tt> issues commands only in
the beginning, not begin and end like <tt>Environment</tt>. <tt>Paragraph</tt>
issues no commands at all.
<h4>
LatexName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whopr</h4>
This is it folks. This is the link between the LyX appearance and the LaTeX
appearance, by linking the LyX style with the LaTeX commands in the Preamble.
<h4>
Font</h4>
Between this line and its corresponding EndFont line go all the attributes
of the font.
<h4>
Size&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Giant</h4>
This says the Size attribute of the font is Giant, which is the largest
possible in the LyX font size naming system.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Font Sizes</h3>
Speaking of fonts, Lyx and LaTeX have different names for various font
sizes. Use the LaTex font sizes in LaTeX commands destined to change the
font size in the finished product, and the LyX size designations in LyX
style statements.

<h3>
\newcommnd, \newenvironment, et al</h3>
You just used \newcommand to implement a font size in the finished product,
but there are actually several similar LaTeX commands.
<h4>
\newenvironment</h4>
The syntax here is:
<pre>\newenvironment{name}[num]{before}{after}</pre>
Where <tt>{name}</tt> is the name of the new environment, <tt>[num]</tt>
is optional and beyond the scope of this discussion, <tt>{before}</tt>
is text and commands run before the content, and <tt>{after}</tt> is the
text and commands run after the content. Typically the <tt>{after}</tt>
"undoes"&nbsp; the effect of the <tt>{before}</tt>.
<p><tt>\newenvironment</tt> must be used ONLY when the environment didn't
yet exist. To modify an existing environment use <tt>\renewenvironment</tt>.
</p><h4>
\renewenvironment</h4>
Syntax and functionality is the same as \newenvironment, except it modifies
an already existing environment.
<pre>\newenvironment{name}[num]{before}{after}</pre>

<h4>
\newcommand</h4>
\newcommand{name}[num]{definition}
<br>&nbsp;
<h1>
<a name="programs"></a>Programs to help with Lyx</h1>

<h2>
makelyxbook.cpp</h2>
This software allows you to make dummy Lyx books for the purposes of format
and performance testing. You can modify the nature of the book (how many
Subsections per Section, and how much standard text gets printed in that
subsection), by modifying the source code. At the top of the file (just
after the top of file comments) are the following constants you can modify:
<pre>#define PARTSPERBOOK 2
#define CHAPTERSPERPART 4
#define SECTIONSPERCHAPTER 4
#define SUBSECTIONSPERSECTION 2
#define SUBSUBSECTIONSPERSUBSECTION 1
#define PARAGRAPHSPERSUBSUBSECTION 2
#define SUBPARAGRAPHSPERPARAGRAPH 2</pre>
Because of a bug in the program you can't set any of them to zero, but
you can keep them from printing.
<p>At the bottom of the program are the print() methods for each of the
Environment objects (Subparagraph, Paragraph, Subsubsection, Subsection,
Section, Chapter, Part, Book). To keep one from printing, simply give it
an empty print method (or comment out the existing print method code. Code
in the print method must print the appropriate header, print the text under
the header, and update the Stats object with what has been printed. It's
fairly obvious.
</p><p>Here's how you use the program:
</p><blockquote>
<li>
Create a new Lyx document</li>

<blockquote>
<li>
File/New</li>

<li>
Layout/Document/Document</li>

<li>
In the Class dropdown, select either Book, Book (AMS), or Book (Koma-Script)</li>

<li>
Click the OK button to return to the Lyx document</li>

<li>
Type in the word "placeholder".</li>

<li>
File/Save as, and save as x.lyx.</li>
</blockquote>

<li>
Modify makelyxbook.cpp:</li>

<blockquote>
<li>
Modify the per-parent constants</li>

<li>
Modify the various class's print() methods</li>

<li>
Compile the program to <tt>a.out</tt></li>
</blockquote>

<li>
Create the document</li>

<ul>
<li>
<tt>./a.out &gt; temp.tmp</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>vim temp.tmp x.lyx</tt></li>

<li>
Yank entirety of <tt>temp.tmp</tt></li>

<li>
Switch to <tt>x.lyx</tt></li>

<li>
Paste just before the line saying <tt>\the_end</tt></li>

<li>
Save <tt>x.lyx</tt> and quit vim</li>

//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Placing a value of 0 for any of these will cause in infinite
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loop.
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To implement zero child environments in the book, simply
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; empty the corresponding class's print() method.&nbsp; #
//
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 0.1.0 was a lame OOP implementation.

//SOURCE CODE CONFIGURATION:
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The test book output is controlled by source code changes to
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two sections of this program. First are the child per parent
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; constants (PARTSPERBOOK, CHAPTERSPERPART,
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTIONSPERCHAPTER, SUBSECTIONSPERSECTION,
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SUBSUBSECTIONSPERSUBSECTION,
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PARAGRAPHSPERSUBSUBSECTION,and
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SUBPARAGRAPHSPERPARAGRAPH). These constants
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are located at the top of the source file. These constants
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; control how many children each environment object has. For
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instance, a CHAPTERSPERPART of 3 would mean each part
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contains three chapters. These constants are at the top
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the program, just below these comments.
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, each environment has a print routine that
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; controls how it prints and how it reports that printing to
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Stats object. Here is where you control how much
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; standard text is printed for each environment object.&nbsp;
//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those print routines are at the bottom of the program.

otl2lyx.vim</h2>
The following Vim script converts an outline with tab defined indentation
into Lyx code suitable for the structure of a book:
<br>&nbsp;

</tbody></table>

<h3>
Note the following:</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Replace each ^I with a tab character.</li>

<li>
Because of the \r substitutions, this works only in UNIX like environments.</li>

<li>
Because of the use of \r\r the preceding works only on Linux/Unix/BSD boxes.
It won't work in a Windows environment.</li>

<li>
The preceding is for Book or Koma-script Book or AMS Book document class.</li>

<li>
You must append it onto a empty lyx file created with the Book or Koma
book document class. Use Vim or other quality text editor to do the appending.</li>

<li>
WARNING! Do not use otl2lyx.vim directly, as it could mess up your outline.
Instead call it from a script that first copies your outline to a temporary
file so the vim script can work on the temporary file.</li>

<li>
Note that lyxxyl is simply a place holder -- it could be any string unlikely
to occur in the original outline.</li>

<li>
If you're looking for an outline processor to do tab indented outlines,
and you know VI, you can use VimOutliner at http://www.troubleshooters.com/projects/vimoutliner/index.htm.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Using otl2lyx.vim to Fill a Lyx Book With Your Outline Structure</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Create a new Lyx document</li>

<ul>
<li>
File/New</li>

<li>
Layout/Document/Document</li>

<li>
In the Class dropdown, select either Book, Book (AMS), or Book (Koma-Script)</li>

<li>
Click the OK button to return to the Lyx document</li>

<li>
Type in the word "placeholder".</li>

<li>
File/Save as, and save as x.lyx.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Run otl2lyx.vim</li>

<ul>
<li>
Make a temporary copy of the outline to be converted to Lyx. To preserve
the integrity of your original outline, you'll process only the temporary
copy.</li>

<li>
Edit the temporary copy in the Vim editor on a UNIX, BSD, Linux, or any
other UNIX workalike. Because of the \r line insertions, this won't work
on Windows.</li>

<li>
From within Vim, run otl2lyx.vim with the following command:</li>

<br><tt>: source otl2lyx.vim</tt>
<li>
Note that your file now looks like Lyx code.</li>

<li>
Save with the <tt>:w</tt> command.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Insert the Lyx-ized outline into your new Lyx document</li>

<ul>
<li>
From the top of the file, type <tt>yG</tt> to yank (copy) the entire file
into the main register</li>

<li>
Edit the Lyx doc you created earlier with the following command:</li>

<br><tt>: e x.lyx</tt>
<li>
Place your cursor on the word "placeholder" you typed earlier. It will
be near the bottom of <tt>x.lyx</tt>.</li>

<li>
Copy the lyx-ized version of your outline by pressing <tt>P</tt> (upper
case P).</li>

<li>
Go to the bottom of the file again and find the line that says "placeholder".</li>

<li>
Delete the line that says "placeholder".</li>

<li>
File/save</li>

<li>
<tt>x.lyx</tt> now contains the exact structure of your original outline.</li>

<a name="_StrongarmingDate"></a>Strongarming the date in a LyX document</h1>
Many LyX documents "help" you by automatically inserting a date in the
document, and if you don't say otherwise, it will be the date it's printed
or converted to postscript or PDF. Obviously this isn't what you want.
<p>To fix the date at the date the doc was written, do one of these two
things:
</p><ol>
<li>
Hardcode the desired date in the Date environment.</li>

<li>
Hardcode \date{1/30/2002} as ERT (TeX) at the top of the document</li>
</ol>
Note that because the Letter document class has no date environment, only
#2 will work in letters.
<h1>
<a name="IncorporatingLayoutFiles"></a>Incorporating Layout Files</h1>
LyX finds its layout files in two places:
<ol>
<li>
In <tt>~/.lyx/layouts/</tt>.</li>

<li>
In the <tt>/usr/local/texmf/tex/latex/</tt> tree</li>
</ol>
But maybe you really want your layout (<tt>mybook.layout</tt>) in the directory
containing <tt>mybook.lyx</tt> (<tt>/data/books/mybook</tt>). That way
the layout file is always backed up with the book, and isn't trashed when
you reinstall the operating sytsem. To accomplish that, you simply create
a symbolic link:
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>ln -s /d/at/books/utp/utpbook.layout /home/slitt/.lyx/layouts/utpbook.layout</pre>
After doing this, you might need to run the texhash program, and you'll
probably need to perform Edit-&gt;Reconfigure from the Lyx menu.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>However, you might want your layout file to accompany your book document's
file. Remember, your book document is worthless without the layout file
that produced it, and even if you manage to recreate the layout file, any
differences will cause big changes in the book.
