Category: Kooks
Posted on: September 18, 2007 9:06 PM, by PZ Myers

Oh, joy. We've got a new crop of persistent Religiots pissing and moaning in the comments. They're whining that I'm mean, that all the regular commenters are mean, that the fact that some good scientists are also Christian somehow validates Christian belief, that I can't criticize scientists who are working at more prestigious universities, and that my tactics are bad. I don't know why they're here; it's not as if we're going to be converted by their inanities, or that they're going to persuade us to accept any of their claims.

Let's break it down into simple sentences and ideas.

Yeah, we're mean. We're actually rather proud of it, so don't waste your breath. Do you also walk up to Keira Knightley and tell her she's beautiful, expecting that she'll start wearing a bag over her head?

We know that you can be a good scientist and religious, and I've never said otherwise. Some great scientists have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, too. It doesn't mean ALS is a good thing.

Swarms of perfervid Christians and timid agnostics and atheists waving their arms and urgently warning us that atheist strategies aren't working isn't exactly scaring us. It's not as if we're stupid enough to believe you want us to have more effective strategies for deprogramming victims of the church.

You aren't going to deter us.

Here is the bottom line.

There is this old myth about a god who has sex with his human mother to give birth to himself, who grows up to be killed (but not really), and this depreciated sacrifice somehow means everyone else gets to go to heaven when they die. If they believe it, that is; otherwise they go to hell and suffer for eternity.

Now I'm supposed to{\ldots}

    *

      {\ldots}believe in this fairy tale myself;
    *

      {\ldots}believe that accepting this fairy tale helps people be better human beings;
    *

      {\ldots}believe that accepting this fairy tale helps people be better scientists;
    *

      {\ldots}regard people who swallow this fairy tale with the same respect I do those who see through the nonsense;
    *

      {\ldots}refrain from criticizing this fairy tale; and/or
    *

      {\ldots}pretend this fairy tale isn't a load of ridiculous bullshit.

No, it's never going to happen. I will never accept or even respect your fairy tale.

Sorry.

One more try. Here's a simple statement that, if you grasp it, you will realize there is no point hanging around here anymore.

The Nicene Creed is not a profession of the basic orthodoxy of the Christian faith. It's a rationality test.

If you believe one line of it, you've failed.},

Steinachs Versuche {\"u}ber Geschlechtsumwandlung sowie seine Hodentransplantationen gegen die Homosexualit{\"a}t.   

``Von Masse und Beschaffenheitinnerer Dr{\"u}senstoffe h{\"a}ngt es eben restlos ab, wie ein Mensch denkt, wohin es ihn treibt, welches daher seine Charaktereigenschaften und geistigen Geschicke sind!  Ja wir haben es fest in der Hand, experimentell-therapeutisch die Zusammensetzung jener Dr{\"u}senstoffe zu ver{\"a}ndern; und alsbald stellt sich uns eine ganz andere Quantit{\"a}t und Qualit{\"a}t Mensch vor!  Aus einem spielerischen, geschlechtsfrenden oder perversen, fettleibigen Duckm{\"a}user wird durch Einf{\"u}hrung von Hodensubstanz ein ernster, entschlossener, behaarter, muskelkr{\"a}ftiger, arbeits- und liebesfreudiger Mann!  Aus einem zwergartig untersetzten Trottel mit faltiger, schuppender Haut, rissigen N{\"a}geln, offenen Geschw{\"u}ren, bl{\"o}dem, glasigem Blick wird durch Einverleibung von Schilddr{\"u}sensubstanz ein hochgewachsener, schlanker, glatt- und heilh{\"a}utiger, offenblickender und aufgeweckter Mensch.``

	Abstract = {Yes, Virginia, There Is A Hot Hand Dateline: 12/21/97  

DEAR EDITOR: I am 8 years old. Some of my friends say there is no Hot Hand. Papa says, ``If you see it in The Game, it is so.`` Please tell me the truth, is there a Hot Hand? 
-- Virginia 

VIRGINIA: Your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except that which they calculate. They think that nothing can be which is not supported by their little numbers. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men's or children's are little. In this great game of ours, man is a mere insect, an ant in his intellect, as compared with the boundless world about him, as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge. 

Yes, Virginia, there is a Hot Hand. It exists as certainly as love and home court advantage and Michael Jordan exist, and you know that they abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how dreary would be the world if there were no Hot Hand! It would be as dreary as if there were no Virginias. There would be no childlike faith then, no autographs, no hero worship to make tolerable the excesses of sport. We should have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The eternal light with which childhood fills the world would be extinguished. 

Not believe in the Hot Hand! You might as well not believe in zone defense! You might get your papa to hire men to count all of the shots of the Philadelphia 76ers, but even if they did not see a streaky shooter, what would that prove? Nobody sees a Hot Hand, but that is no sign that there is none. The most real things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see. 

No Hot Hand! Thank God, it lives, and it's on a roll. A thousand years from now, Virginia, nay, ten times ten thousand years from now, it will continue to make glad the heart of basketball fans. 

...Skepticism of a Skeptical Age... 

Amos Tversky's study on whether streak shooters exist was built on the classic skepticism of a scientist. It is a scientist's job to doubt the existence of something unless overwhelming proof can be generated in support of it. In this way, Tversky did not prove that streaks don't exist. He just stated that there was no proof that they do exist. 

In our leap to the conclusion that streaks do not exist, we demonstrate our susceptibility to the skepticism of a skeptical age. 

...It Exists As Certainly As Home Court Advantage... 

In fact, there is no denying that a home court advantage exists. The reasons for it may not be fully known, but its presence cannot be denied. 

Just as having the home court helps a team win, there are real factors that help a player shoot. If Eddie Johnson covers Michael Jordan, you know that Jordan will take him to school. If Eric Montross covers David Robinson, you know that Robinson is going to get a lot of points. You might even say that Robinson is hot when Montross is guarding him. 

...If They Did Not See A Streaky Shooter, What Would That Prove? ... 

Though Tversky saw no evidence of a hot hand, that does not mean it does not exist. I can generate a sequence of shots where the offense knows a player is hot, but the sequence itself would show no evidence of streakiness. 

First of all, let's agree on a test for streak shooting, one that is different from Tversky's: 

When you watch a game and you think someone is hot, keep track of their shots and it should show them shooting better than their average. If you think someone is cold, keep track of their shots and it should show them shooting worse than average. Regardless of whether Tversky's tests show that streaks exist, if you can really see when a player is hot and cold, there is information there that we can take advantage of and that teams probably do take advantage of.  This test explicitly evaluates whether we see something real. If we can see something that tips us off that a player is hot, then it exists. 

Such a test can lead to a sequence of shots that, by Tversky's test, is not a streak. If what we see occurs somewhat randomly -- like Montross covering Robinson until he picks up enough fouls to go out of the game and a better defender comes in to replace him -- then, even though a team recognizes a streak (recognizes a mismatch), the stats of Tversky's test won't see it. 

As a concrete numerical example, say that a team knows when a player is hot, hot meaning that he hits 65% of his shots during this time. He is hot only 40% of the time he shoots the ball. The rest of the time (60% of the time), he hits only 40% of his shots. If the times at which a player is hot is random due to the defense playing him differently, that is immaterial to the strategy of getting the ball to a hot hand. When you simulate this type of sequence, it looks random. It looks like the player shoots 50% and without streaks according to Tversky's test. (An interactive demo is probably more than most people could understand, but if you write to me, I can send you one or the algorithm to do it yourself in a spreadsheet.) 

...Making Glad The Heart of Basketball Fans... 

In the first round of the NCAA Tournament a few years ago, I began to sense my own hot streak. Every shot seemed to hit the mark. Every pass of mine was converted and returned later. The game felt completely natural. Ours was a great team, better than the sum of the parts. I'd dream at night of how well everything was working, enough that I was only half asleep yet completely rested. I'd dream of playing again the next day. 

When I had to stop playing a few months later, the streak ended. It was a fantastic few months. I'd like to believe that there was a reason for the streak and that I can get it back. Calling it just dumb luck doesn't seem to do justice to the many little reasons that made the streak feel so good.

Methoden des praktischen Z{\"u}chters verbessert durch Mendel.  Begrenzte Wirksamkeit der Zuchtwahl---man kann damit eine Mischrasse reinigen oder eine extreme Variante herausaarbeiten, aber keine neue Rasse erzeugen.  Neue Eigenschaften werden durch Umwelteinwirkung erzeugt.

In der Rassenhygiene oder Eugenik spielt Zuchtwahl eine wichtige Rolle, auch wenn sie nur schlechtes eliminiert.  K. bef{\"u}rwortet die Regelungen der Ehen und die Auslese unter den Einwanderern, wie sie in den Vereinigten Staaten praktiziert wird.  Er ist sogar f{\"u}rs Kastrieren der Minderwertigen, und meint, da{\ss} es in vielen F{\"a}llen nicht nur f{\"u}r die Rasse, sondern auch f{\"u}r den Betroffenen vorteilhaft ist: [15] ``Viele verbrecherische Triebe und besonders Geisteskrankheiten wurzeln n{\"a}mlich im Geschlechtlichen: ist die Geschlechtsdr{\"u}se beseitigt, so ist nicht nur die Gefahr beseitigt, da{\ss} der Verbrecherinstinkt sich vererbe, sondern oft die betreffende Person auch selbst psychisch gesundet.``

Anwendung der Biologie auf die Ethik: Erkennung einer allgemeinen gegenseitigen Hilfe in der Natur sowie eines erziehbaren, ethischen Gesamtwillen.  Erkenntnis, da{\ss} die Tat, das Wort, der Gedanke, eine stammesgeschichtliche Tragweite hat.  Christliche Erl{\"o}sung hei{\ss}t Erl{\"o}sung aller Generationen der Menschheit, also planm{\"a}{\ss}ige Lebensbeherrschung durch Vererbung erworbener Eigenschaften.  

Auch in der Soziologie und der Wirtschaft mu{\ss} man auf die biologie achten: [21, Sperrschrift im Original] ``Biologisch gesprochen hei{\ss}t gut wirtschaften nichts anderes als: den Daseinskampf wesentlich in Daseinshilfe, den Parasitismus g{\"a}nzlich in Symbiose umzuwandeln.``

Schlie{\ss}lich erz{\"a}hlt er von seiner Idee f{\"u}r eine Lebenstechnik oder ``Organik``.  Steinachs Operationen.  Die herk{\"o}mmliche Eugenik, weil rein eliminierend, ist nur eine Vorstufe dazu: [24, Sperrschrift originial] ``{\"U}ber blo{\ss}e Heilung krankhafter, Ausmerzung sch{\"a}dlicher Eigenschaften hinaus f{\"u}hrt unsere Stra{\ss}e zur Steigerung lebenserhaltender, zer Hervorrufung entwicklungserh{\"o}hender Eigenschaften empor!``

Maschinentechnik ist entwicklungshemmend, weil sie die Umwelt dem Menschen anpa{\ss}t und die Entwicklungsanreize eliminiert.}}
