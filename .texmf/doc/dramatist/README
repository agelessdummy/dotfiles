This package contains the following files:

     - `Readme': this file.
     - `dramatist.dtx': the package source file.
     - `dramatist.ins': the installation driver file.

In order to get file `dramatist.sty' you have to run tex on
`dramatist.ins' (you'll get also the example files).

In order to get documentation you have to run latex on
`dramatist.dtx'.

Then move `dramatist.sty' in a directory where TeX looks for style
files and move documentation files in the directory you like.
N.B.: if you have a file `docstrip.cfg' in your system you only
need to create directories <basedir>/tex/latex/dramatist and
<basedir>/doc/latex/dramatist - TeX will automatically move the
files in these directories.
