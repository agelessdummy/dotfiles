## Short Log Lines

    - Inciting Incidnet Occurs

    - Specific Protanonist

    - Objective

    - Stakes

We also need to recognize how these components fit into the structure. Like I said before there are numerous formats you can use, and you should always adjust this to suit your particular story. But this structural formula is a great starting point:

    + When [INCITING INCIDENT OCCURS], a [SPECIFIC PROTAGONIST] must [OBJECTIVE], or else [STAKES].

## Long Log Lines

    - SETTING: When and where your story takes place.

    - PROTAGONIST: Who your main character (hero or heroine) is.

    - PROBLEM: The issue or event that causes your Protagonist to take action.

    - ANTAGONIST: Who or what tries to stop your Protagonist.

    - CONFLICT: The major obstacle, difficulty or dilemma your protagonist faces.

    - GOAL: What your Protagonist hopes to win, achieve, find or defeat.

Then insert those archetypes in the [Killogator logline](http://graemeshimmin.com/writing-a-logline-for-a-novel/) formula below to make a sentence, or two, that captures the core of your story.

    In a (SETTING) a (PROTAGONIST) has a (PROBLEM) (caused by an ANTAGONIST) and (faces CONFLICT) as they try to (achieve a GOAL).
